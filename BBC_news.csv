A woman is trying to knit 2,020 jumpers and cardigans in a year to donate to child refugees.Eileen Johnson, 79, from Cardigan, Ceredigion, said she got the idea from a giant cardigan knitted in 2011 to mark the town's 900th anniversary.She spends some of her time sitting in the window of a cafe knitting and teaches children who may come in.More than 100 items have been knitted among her team of volunteers and the aim is to complete by September 2020.""I was born during the war and my mum taught me how to knit while in the air raid shelter when I was three years old,"" she said.

Single malt Scotch whisky exported to the United States is to face a tariff of 25% from 18 October.The new duty is part of a raft of measures being imposed by the US in retaliation against EU subsidies given to aircraft maker Airbus.Other goods being targeted include cashmere sweaters, dairy products, pork, books and some machinery.Scotch exports to the US last year were worth $1.3bn (£1bn), with single malts accounting for a large share of that. The US was given the go-ahead to impose tariffs on $7.5bn (£6.1bn) of goods it imports from the EU following a World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling on Wednesday.
It is the latest chapter in a 15-year battle between the US and the EU over illegal subsidies for planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing.

The ruling by the WTO will mean tariffs on EU goods ranging from aircraft to agricultural products.Brussels has threatened to retaliate similarly against US goods.'Serious situation'Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said it was a blow to the Scotch whisky sector.""This is a serious situation for the industry,"" she said. ""We heard overnight that a 25% import tariff will be imposed on all single malts into the United States and also all Scotch whisky liqueurs, and that's from a position of zero. ""We've had a zero tariff on imports to the United States for the past 25 years, so this is quite a hike.""The Scotch whisky industry directly employs about 11,000 people in Scotland, and many more indirectly through its supply chain.More than 7,000 of the jobs are in rural areas across the country.A spokesman for the UK's Department for International Trade said: ""Resorting to tariffs is not in the interests of the UK, EU or US. ""The UK is working closely with the US, EU and European partners to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing disputes.""The UK, through the EU, is seeking confirmation from the WTO that we have complied fully with WTO rulings regarding support to Airbus, and should not be subject to tariffs.""How did this row start?

Airbus' A380 was unfairly subsidised, WTO says
The US first filed the case in 2004, arguing that cheap European loans for Airbus amounted to illegal state subsidies.The WTO decided in favour of the US, which subsequently complained that the EU and certain member countries were not in compliance with the decision, prompting years of further wrangling.The US had sought to impose tariffs on about $11bn in goods. Though the WTO cut that figure to $7.5bn, Wednesday's decision still marks the largest penalty of its kind in the organisation's history.The WTO's dispute settlement body must formally adopt the ruling but is not expected to overturn the decision."

Roger Jenkins was chairman of investment banking in the Middle East
Three former top Barclays executives are due in court on Monday charged with fraud linked to how the bank raised billions of pounds from Qatar in 2008.The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) case centres on alleged undisclosed payments to Qatar in return for cash that helped the bank during the financial crisis.Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris, and Richard Boath all deny wrongdoing.    Former Barclays chief executive John Varley, their co-defendant in a previous trial, was acquitted in June.The SFO's criminal proceedings against the bank itself were also dismissed by a court last year. Mr Varley and Barclays had each denied wrongdoing.
Mr Jenkins, 64, was the chairman of investment banking in the Middle East, while Mr Kalaris, 63, headed the wealth division and Mr Boath, 60, led the European corporate finance arm.The trio is each charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation.Former Barclays head cleared of fraud chargesThe case centres on claims of secret payments to Qatar as part of a deal to raise more than £11bn ($13.6bn) from investors in two tranches in June and October 2008.It is claimed that these multi-million pound payments to investors, including to the then prime minister of the Gulf state, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, were not property disclosed to the markets.The cash injection from Qatar helped Barclays avoid the government bailout fate of High Street rivals, including Royal Bank of Scotland.The defendants were charged in 2017 after the SFO spent years investigating the allegations. The trial is regarded as a high stakes case for the SFO, which has been accused of failing to pursue companies and individuals over their part in the financial crisis.The charges against Mr Jenkins relate to his involvement in the June and October Qatar fundraisings. The cases of the two other men relate to the June fundraising only.Monday's Old Bailey trial will start with jury selection, and the case is expected to last several months."

A chief constable has written to the US Embassy in London demanding the return of an American diplomat's wife who is a suspect in a fatal crash inquiry.Harry Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike collided with a car near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August.The diplomat's wife, named as Anne Sacoolas, left the UK despite telling police she did not plan to.Nick Adderley, of Northamptonshire Police, has urged the embassy to waive her diplomatic immunity.He said he had appealed to US authorities ""in the strongest terms"".
Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, said leaving the country was ""such a dishonourable thing to do"" and urged Ms Sacoolas to ""come back"". His father, Tim Dunn, said they needed to get the truth.Ms Charles added: ""We are not out to get her put behind bars. If that's what the justice system ends up doing then we can't stop that but we're not out to do that, we're out to try and get some peace for ourselves.""The US Embassy previously said ""security and privacy considerations"" precluded it from naming the suspect.

One in 10 consultant psychiatrist positions in Scotland are vacant, according to a new report, leading to claims the profession is facing a ""workforce crisis"". A census by the Royal College of Psychiatrists found that vacancy rates are particularly high in child and adolescent mental health services. More than one in six consultant posts (17.5%) in Camhs is vacant. Ministers say they have invested £54m in mental health services.The census found that 72 out of 747 consultant psychiatry posts (9.7%) in Scotland are vacant. In 2017, one in 16 posts (6.3%) were vacant.
Across the UK, the vacancy rate is 9.6%. Due to retireProfessor John Crichton, chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) in Scotland, said: ""We have a workforce crisis on our hands and need more junior doctors to choose psychiatry.""Simply put the supply does not meet the demand.""He said many psychiatrists were expected to retire within five years and there had been a drop in the numbers of psychiatrists choosing to progress to higher training.Junior doctors need to spend six years training before gaining consultant status, he added, which also contributes to the shortage.He said the Scottish government needed to do more.

The rate of knife attacks in some regional towns and cities is higher than in many London boroughs, BBC analysis of police figures suggests.Overall, London remains the most dangerous part of England and Wales - but data, obtained from 34 of the 43 police forces, shows the rate of serious knife crime offences rising sharply in some areas outside London, and outstripping some of the city's boroughs in places like the city of Manchester, Slough, Liverpool and Blackpool.
Ten charts on the rise of knife crime
Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims
""We are suffering just as much as anywhere else,"" said Byron Highton whose brother Jon-Jo was 18 when he was stabbed to death with a sword and an axe as he walked home in Preston, in 2014. ""The whole country is suffering from knife crime, but small cities in the north like Preston get no mention.""
Under Freedom of Information Law, the BBC asked all 43 regional police forces in England and Wales for details of serious knife crime in their area.
Serious knife crime is defined as any assault, robbery, threat to kill, murder, attempted murder or sexual offence involving a knife or sharp instrument. In Lancashire, the figures show knife crime has almost doubled in five years, rising from 455 offences in 2014, to 981 in 2018.

""The scary part is how bad is it going to be in 10 years if this generation isn't fixed.""

Manchester, Liverpool, Slough and Nottingham are all in the top 25 most dangerous places in England and Wales for serious knife crime. The safest areas with less than one crime per 10,000 people include Dorset, the Cotswolds, Monmouthshire and the Malvern.In Scotland, police collect crime statistics differently, so there are no separate records for knife attacks. However, knife possession has increased in recent years, with more than 2,300 crimes reported last year.

The girl 'threatened with a machete'It's not just young men who are affected. In Blackpool, students Keeley, 17, and Lauren, 18, have both been threatened on the estate where they live, with knives brandished in relatively trivial teenage disagreements.  ""I got threatened with a machete in a park by a group of lads when I was playing football,"" Keeley said. ""They wanted to play in our half, but we said no.""

Students Lauren (l) and Keeley have both been threatened with stabbing near their homes
Lauren says she doesn't feel safe in the town: ""Me and my mate were walking home and a guy came out and threatened to stab one of my mates.""In 2018, the resort had 14.3 serious knife crime offences per 10,000 people, putting it in the top 25 most dangerous places for knife crime in England and Wales, of the 275 areas which gave data.  Drugs gangs, school exclusion rates, poverty, unemployment and cuts to services have all been blamed for a rise in youth violence in towns like Blackpool and Preston.Last month, official figures showed eight of the 10 most deprived neighbourhoods in England were in Blackpool.  ""There is a significant issue with county lines [drugs courier] gangs in Blackpool, and from that we are seeing that means a lot of young people are carrying knives,"" Ashley Hackett, chief executive of Blackpool Football Club Community Trust , told the BBC. ""We have an awful lot of children and teenagers who are living in deprivation and whatever way they can find to earn money and support households, legally and illegally, they are doing it. That includes drugs and knives,"" he added. In 2018, almost half of all suspects in serious knife crime offences in England and Wales, were aged 24 and under.
'Emotionally exploited' The experiences of young women like Keeley and Lauren are becoming more commonplace. Last year, 15% of knife crime suspects were female and, including those attacked in domestic abuse incidents, a quarter of victims of knife crime were women. Dr Mike Rowe of Liverpool University, who has been observing police officers at work for the past six years, told the BBC: ""Girls and young women are being exploited to carry weapons because they are much less likely to be stopped and searched by police. ""The attention on male suspects may lead to the deliberate recruitment of young women.""Anti-knife crime campaigner Lydia Lawrence, who has herself survived two stabbings by two different women, agrees that gang violence is on the rise, and girls with low self-esteem are being emotionally exploited. Ms Lawrence, who's from west London, was first a victim of knife crime aged just 12, when she was cut on her face. She nearly died when she was 21, after being stabbed through her kidney and liver. Ms Lawrence, who was born in prison, excluded from school at 12 and homeless by 16, warned that girls from troubled backgrounds and broken homes are the most at risk.Dr Rowe believes police responses to knife crime have been ""seriously hampered by the cuts in the past eight years and more"", contributing to a fall in the number of cases solved.
He said that every time there is a stabbing, officers are pulled from neighbourhood teams to guard the scene as forensics are gathered. ""It's these neighbourhood teams that would normally be expected to gather the intelligence which investigations of knife crime and gang activity rely on. ""So there is a vicious cycle in which rising demands hinder the capacity to investigate those very crimes.""

People 'scared to leave homes' over drugs
Assistant Chief Constable Jackie Sebire, the national lead in tackling serious violent crime at the National Police Chiefs' Council, blamed police funding cuts for the fall in charge rates. ""The large reduction in police funding since 2010 has meant fewer detectives with less time and a bigger workload taking on long investigations, meaning it can be more difficult to get a charge.""In some cases police have fearful witnesses, and victims who do not feel able to engage with officers or the court process.""This means there is little possibility of a prosecution. ""Some forces who have been given additional funding to tackle violence are using that to improve forensic capabilities, so even when the victim is unwilling to proceed, police can still progress a case.""A Home Office spokesperson responded: ""We are taking action to tackle the violent crime which has such a devastating impact on our communities.""This includes supporting the police by recruiting 20,000 new police officers over the next three years, making it easier for them to use stop and search powers, and investing £10m in additional funding to allow forces to increase the number of officers carrying Tasers."""

Commemoration events kicked off on Saturday
New Zealand is marking a divisive anniversary - 250 years since the British explorer Captain James Cook set foot in the country.Cook and his crew of the HMS Endeavour came to shore at Gisborne on 8 October 1769 ushering in colonial rule.But New Zealand - or Aotearoa in Maori - had been populated by the Maori people for several hundred years. Some say this milestone should not be celebrated as it had a detrimental impact on the Maori community.Last week British High Commissioner Laura Clarke delivered a statement of regret to local tribes - known as iwi - over the death of nine indigenous people during the first meeting between Cook and the Maori. But she stopped short of issuing an apology.
Though James Cook's exploration of New Zealand dominates history books, Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was the first European to catch sight of it, in 1642. Maori people from Polynesian islands are believed to have arrived in New Zealand hundreds of years prior to the first Europeans.What celebrations are planned?New Zealand has planned several days of events to mark the milestone of the first meeting between Maori and Europeans. On Tuesday, a flotilla of ships including a replica of the Endeavour reached Gisborne, a city on the east coast of North Island. Members of Parliament Kelvin Davis and Kiritapu Allan went aboard to greet the crew. Protesters were also reportedly present in the town, which is also known by its Maori name of Turanga-nui-a-Kiwa.

""We were only really telling, I believe, 50% of the story, and not always telling it well,"" she said. New Zealand should continue to learn and tell the full story of its past, she added.Why is the anniversary controversial?When James Cook arrived on the Turanganui River, what is now Gisborne, the first encounter between his crew and the Maori inhabitants was deadly.A leader of the Ngati Oneone group was immediately shot and killed after what is believed to be a misunderstanding over a ceremonial challenge. At least eight other Maori were killed.

In Gisborne, a statue of Cook has been repeatedly defaced with graffiti and is to be replaced."

Commemoration events kicked off on Saturday
New Zealand is marking a divisive anniversary - 250 years since the British explorer Captain James Cook set foot in the country.Cook and his crew of the HMS Endeavour came to shore at Gisborne on 8 October 1769 ushering in colonial rule.But New Zealand - or Aotearoa in Maori - had been populated by the Maori people for several hundred years. Some say this milestone should not be celebrated as it had a detrimental impact on the Maori community.Last week British High Commissioner Laura Clarke delivered a statement of regret to local tribes - known as iwi - over the death of nine indigenous people during the first meeting between Cook and the Maori. But she stopped short of issuing an apology.
Though James Cook's exploration of New Zealand dominates history books, Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was the first European to catch sight of it, in 1642. Maori people from Polynesian islands are believed to have arrived in New Zealand hundreds of years prior to the first Europeans.What celebrations are planned?New Zealand has planned several days of events to mark the milestone of the first meeting between Maori and Europeans. On Tuesday, a flotilla of ships including a replica of the Endeavour reached Gisborne, a city on the east coast of North Island. Members of Parliament Kelvin Davis and Kiritapu Allan went aboard to greet the crew. Protesters were also reportedly present in the town, which is also known by its Maori name of Turanga-nui-a-Kiwa.

But here in Gisborne, the anniversary of Cook's landing has been a time for celebration, reflection and protest, and there was a hostile welcome from Maori groups. They are angry that Cook's arrival has been commemorated in such a significant way.  ""The fact that we have to re-live that traumatisation as a whanau hapu iwi [extended family groups and tribes] is actually quite devastating for us as Maori.

The three low paid workers and their union are launching a no-deal Brexit court case
Three low paid workers and their union are launching a legal challenge to make the prime minister seek an extension to the Brexit deadline.The government has promised EU-law derived employment rights will remain in UK law after Brexit. But if there were a no-deal Brexit, the union says, ministers would have free rein to water down these rights.And workers could no longer rely on the supremacy of EU law, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights or Court of Justice.The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents some 5,000 workers, 1,000 of whom are EU citizens, is currently relying upon these aspects of EU law in a number of worker's rights court cases.
Key workers' rights based on EU law include:
minimum paid holiday
working hours regulation
equal pay
protection against discrimination
consultation on redundancy plans
There are an estimated 3.5 million citizens of other EU member states living and working in the UK.

Brexit: What happened in the UK Supreme Court?
IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee told BBC News: ""Low paid workers, like couriers and cleaners, need all the protections and employment rights they can get. ""Many of these come from EU law and are at serious risk in a no-deal Brexit. ""The IWGB will do everything possible to protect these rights, including legal action to force the prime minister to obey the law and request an extension to the Brexit deadline.""The IWGB challenge joins a similar one in the English and Welsh courts brought by the rights group Liberty and one in the Scottish courts brought by businessman Dale Vince, Jolyon Maugham QC and SNP MP Joanna Cherry. The Scottish case was dismissed by the judge on Monday but the petitioners have announced their intention to appeal. 'Clear breach'The so-called Benn act, named after Labour's Hilary Benn who spearheaded the law's passage through Parliament, requires the prime minister to write to the EU to request an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline if a deal has not been signed off by Parliament by 19 October and if MPs have not voted to leave without a deal.All three actions claim Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he will not seek a time extension in the event of no-deal.It is argued those statements by the prime minister and members of the cabinet seek to frustrate an act of Parliament and so represent a clear breach of the rule of law.  All three actions seek orders compelling Mr Johnson to comply with the act and send a letter to the president of the European Council seeking an extension to 31 January 2020.

Boris Johnson says the government will obey the law - and leave the EU on 31 October
Mr Johnson has previously said the government ""will obey the law - and will come out on 31 October"" in any event, without specifying how he would achieve these apparently contradictory goals.The IWGB says such statements are an attempt to frustrate the purpose of the Benn act and are therefore unlawful.The prime minister's statements have led to speculation the government has identified a legal loophole to get around the Benn actIf the UK appears to be heading towards a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and the prime minister found a way to get around the Benn act, all three legal challenges could end up at the UK Supreme Court in a dramatic last-minute legal bid to prevent a no-deal departure just days before the deadline.'Cunning plan'On Friday, government papers submitted in the Scottish case stated the prime minister would send a letter to the EU asking for a Brexit delay if no deal was agreed by 19 October. Similar assurances, to obey the Benn act and not seek to frustrate it, have been given by the government to the IWGB in pre-action correspondence seen by BBC News.However, a senior Downing Street source has said: ""The government will comply with the Benn act, which only imposes a very specific narrow duty concerning Parliament's letter requesting a delay, drafted by an unknown subset of MPs and pro-EU campaigners, and which can be interpreted in different ways.""But the government is not prevented by the act from doing other things that cause no delay, including other communications, private and public.""People will have to wait to see how this is reconciled. ""The government is making its true position on delay known privately in Europe and this will become public soon.""This has led to increased speculation Downing Street has seen a way around the Benn act. Alternatively, as the BBC's Andrew Marr put it on Sunday: ""Maybe No 10's cunning plan is to pretend they have a cunning plan when actually they don't."""

The report found most temporary release schemes in Northern Ireland prisons were ""functioning well""
Victims should be notified before serving prisoners are allowed out of jail for activities like sport or exercise, a report has said. The Criminal Justice Inspection (CJI) Northern Ireland report was ordered last year after prison staff took five convicted killers on a hiking trip.CJI said external activity rules must be better explained and documented.It also said victims who register for information updates should be contacted before inmates take part in outings.
'It's the one thing you look forward to'
Rehabilitation order sees 400 spared jail'It's the one thing you look forward to'

The Prisoner Release Victim Information Scheme (PRVIS) was established in 2003 but participation levels have been low.
'Walking clubs'Overall however, the report found that most temporary release schemes in Northern Ireland prisons were ""functioning well"".Director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS) Ronnie Armour welcomed the report and its findings.""While legislation provides that the more serious offenders can be detained indefinitely until they are assessed as safe to release, every prisoner in Northern Ireland can expect to be released at some stage,"" the report stated. ""Preparation for release must therefore include efforts to reduce the risks they pose.""The report listed some examples of outings in the prisons' external activity schemes, including Belfast City Marathon, over-50s walking clubs and work placements at theatres and gardening projects.In addition to the external activity schemes, CJI examined home leave, Christmas home leave, temporary release (both accompanied and unaccompanied), compassionate temporary release (to attend a family funeral or visit a critically ill relative), town visits and resettlement leave.It said pre-release testing in its various forms was an essential part of prisoners' rehabilitation as it helps probation services to make decisions on when it was safe for inmates to return to society.""The main concern that arose in this inspection was external activity schemes,"" said CJI's chief inspector, Brendan McGuigan.He said there were examples whereby prisoners had been permitted temporary absence from prison, despite not meeting Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS) criteria.

CJI's chief inspector, Brendan McGuigan, said the report's main concern was external activity schemes
""In one case, the NIPS Prisoner Record and Information System (PRISM), which was designed to incorporate the checks and balances necessary for proper security, was altered so that a prisoner could participate in an external activity scheme,"" the CJI report said.""Subsequent legal advice clarified nothing wrong had been done, though the NIPS acknowledged it was a mistake not to have consulted another government agency which had a potential interest in the case.""The chief inspector said NIPS ""needs to better explain, to its own staff, partner agencies, victims and prisoners, what it is trying to achieve with external activity schemes"".NIPS commissioned CJI to examine pre-release arrangements last year after two controversies involving serving prisoners on temporary release schemes.In September 2018, five convicted killers hiked up Northern Ireland's highest mountain, Slieve Donard, before having tea in the nearby seaside town of Newcastle.
Image caption
The report was in part sparked by a day trip by prisoners to the seaside town of Newcastle, County Down
Four of the inmates were serving lengthy sentences for killing women, and the group of five was accompanied by two prison guards.The following month, a prisoner absconded while subject to pre-release testing.However, the CJI report points to figures which suggested that prisoners who took part in pre-release testing programmes were less likely to end up back in jail for re-offending. Over a four-year period from 2014 to 2018, 20 life-sentenced prisoners were released from a closed prison setting and more than half (12) of them were recalled to jail.By contrast, of the 36 life-sentenced prisoners who were released from the ""more relaxed regime"" of Burren House in Belfast, only two ended up back in jail.

Criminal Justice Inspection (CJI)
In respect of home leave, the report said 80% of all applications from prisoners with a Protestant community background were approved last year, while only 68% were approved in cases where the applicant was from a Catholic background. ""This is consistent with the findings of other inspections that showed poorer outcomes for Catholic prisoners in several respects, including Home Leave applications."" the CJI stated. ""The NIPS had commissioned a piece of research into the reasons for outcomes for Catholic prisoners and has stated an intention to act on the basis of its' findings.""The report makes two strategic recommendations and four operational recommendations to improve pre-release testing arrangements.Among them is a call to promote the Prisoner Release Victim Information Scheme (PRVIS) to encourage more victims to sign up.Only 275 victims were registered in February this year and the authors said many people ""assumed they were registered when they actually were not"".PRVIS was designed as an ""opt-in"" as opposed to an automatic update system because some traumatised victims do not wish to have any further reminders of the perpetrator.CJI said some victims were also ""deterred by the fact that their representations about the prisoner could not be kept confidential"".Other recommendations include exploring the possibility of electronic monitoring of prisoners on temporary release.The CJI also called on the prison authorities to ""review the totality"" of its pre-release testing and home leave schemes to ensure consistency and best practice."

A replica of Cook's ship arrived in Gisborne on Tuesday to both cheers and protests
A flotilla has arrived in New Zealand commemorating the 250th anniversary of the first Europeans to set foot there.British explorer Captain James Cook and the crew of the HMS Endeavour came to shore at Gisborne on 8 October 1769 ushering in colonial rule.Several days of events are taking place to mark the milestone date.But New Zealand had been populated by the Maori people for hundreds of years, and many say it is not an anniversary to celebrate. Last week British High Commissioner Laura Clarke delivered a statement of regret to local tribes - known as iwi - over the death of nine indigenous people during the first meeting between Cook and the Maori. But she stopped short of issuing an apology.
Maori people from Polynesian islands are believed to have arrived in New Zealand - or Aotearoa in Maori - hundreds of years prior to the first Europeans.Who was Captain Cook?Capt Cook had been sent on a mission from the UK to find and map what people at the time believed must be a large continent in the Pacific, south of Australia.

Endeavour, the ship used by Captain James Cook during his great voyage of exploration of 1768- 1771
He didn't find the mythical continent, but on 6 October his cabin boy, Nicholas Young, spotted New Zealand.The crew - including a Tahitian chief and navigator called Tupaia who helped Cook communicate with the Maori - came ashore at Tuuranga-nui, now Gisborne, on the east coast of North Island two days later.Cook went on to sail and chart much of the coast of New Zealand, stopping at several places and establishing relations with Maori residents.He also claimed possession of two areas in the name of the British crown, starting the process of colonisation.  Though James Cook's exploration of New Zealand dominates history books, Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was the first European to catch sight of it, in 1642, but he never made it to land.What commemorations are planned?New Zealand has planned several days of events to mark the milestone of the first meeting between Maori and Europeans.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had kicked off commemoration events on Saturday.In a speech she called for a more open conversation about New Zealand's history, encouraging people to ""imagine what it would be like to hear a story be retold, knowing that, actually, you lost an ancestor directly because of those encounters"".

She said in the past, New Zealand was ""only really telling, I believe, 50% of the story, and not always telling it well"". New Zealand should continue to learn and tell the full story of its past, she added.Then on Tuesday morning, a flotilla of ships including a replica of the Endeavour reached Gisborne.Members of Parliament Kelvin Davis and Kiritapu Allan went aboard to greet the crew. Protesters were also present in the town, which is also known by its Maori name of Turanga-nui-a-Kiwa.Why is the anniversary controversial?The first encounter between Cook's crew and the Maori inhabitants at Gisborne was deadly.A leader of the Ngati Oneone group was immediately shot and killed after what is believed to be a misunderstanding over a ceremonial challenge. At least eight other Maori were killed.

Marise Lent said indigenous rights were being breached repeatedly in New Zealand
Despite the UK's statement of regret, many Maori rights advocates say not enough has been done to acknowledge what happened in those first few days of Cook's arrival.Protesters also say their Maori ancestors were treated unfairly during the colonial era and that today, Maori communities face disproportionate levels of poverty, crime and discrimination as a result. In Gisborne, a statue of Cook has been repeatedly defaced with graffiti and is to be replaced.
Celebration and protestPhil Mercer, BBC News, GisborneCrowds were up at sunrise to watch as the replica of Cook's Endeavour sailed through Poverty Bay, or Taranganui-a-kiwa.""We are here to celebrate Captain James Cook and everything that he did and he represents our heritage of which we are very proud,"" said Val McGreevy, a Gisborne resident.   But here in Gisborne, the anniversary of Cook's landing has been a time for celebration, reflection and protest, and there was a hostile welcome from Maori groups. They are angry that Cook's arrival has been commemorated in such a significant way.  ""The fact that we have to re-live that traumatisation as a whanau hapu iwi [extended family groups and tribes] is actually quite devastating for us as Maori. Our indigenous rights have been breached over and over again,"" said Marise Lent, one of the demonstrators."

The report found most temporary release schemes in Northern Ireland prisons were ""functioning well""
Victims should be notified before serving prisoners are allowed out of jail for activities like sport or exercise, a report has said. The Criminal Justice Inspection (CJI) Northern Ireland report was ordered last year after prison staff took five convicted killers on a hiking trip.CJI said external activity rules must be better explained and documented.It also said victims who register for information updates should be contacted before inmates take part in outings.
'It's the one thing you look forward to'
Rehabilitation order sees 400 spared jail'It's the one thing you look forward to'
NI prison no longer 'unsafe and unstable'
The Prisoner Release Victim Information Scheme (PRVIS) was established in 2003 but participation levels have been low.
'Walking clubs'Overall however, the report found that most temporary release schemes in Northern Ireland prisons were ""functioning well"".Director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS) Ronnie Armour welcomed the report and its findings.""While legislation provides that the more serious offenders can be detained indefinitely until they are assessed as safe to release, every prisoner in Northern Ireland can expect to be released at some stage,"" the report stated. ""Preparation for release must therefore include efforts to reduce the risks they pose.""The report listed some examples of outings in the prisons' external activity schemes, including Belfast City Marathon, over-50s walking clubs and work placements at theatres and gardening projects.In addition to the external activity schemes, CJI examined home leave, Christmas home leave, temporary release (both accompanied and unaccompanied), compassionate temporary release (to attend a family funeral or visit a critically ill relative), town visits and resettlement leave.It said pre-release testing in its various forms was an essential part of prisoners' rehabilitation as it helps probation services to make decisions on when it was safe for inmates to return to society.""The main concern that arose in this inspection was external activity schemes,"" said CJI's chief inspector, Brendan McGuigan.He said there were examples whereby prisoners had been permitted temporary absence from prison, despite not meeting Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS) criteria.
Image caption
CJI's chief inspector, Brendan McGuigan, said the report's main concern was external activity schemes
""In one case, the NIPS Prisoner Record and Information System (PRISM), which was designed to incorporate the checks and balances necessary for proper security, was altered so that a prisoner could participate in an external activity scheme,"" the CJI report said.""Subsequent legal advice clarified nothing wrong had been done, though the NIPS acknowledged it was a mistake not to have consulted another government agency which had a potential interest in the case.""The chief inspector said NIPS ""needs to better explain, to its own staff, partner agencies, victims and prisoners, what it is trying to achieve with external activity schemes"".NIPS commissioned CJI to examine pre-release arrangements last year after two controversies involving serving prisoners on temporary release schemes.In September 2018, five convicted killers hiked up Northern Ireland's highest mountain, Slieve Donard, before having tea in the nearby seaside town of Newcastle.
Image caption
The report was in part sparked by a day trip by prisoners to the seaside town of Newcastle, County Down
Four of the inmates were serving lengthy sentences for killing women, and the group of five was accompanied by two prison guards.The following month, a prisoner absconded while subject to pre-release testing.However, the CJI report points to figures which suggested that prisoners who took part in pre-release testing programmes were less likely to end up back in jail for re-offending. Over a four-year period from 2014 to 2018, 20 life-sentenced prisoners were released from a closed prison setting and more than half (12) of them were recalled to jail.By contrast, of the 36 life-sentenced prisoners who were released from the ""more relaxed regime"" of Burren House in Belfast, only two ended up back in jail.

Media caption'To be turfed out is total madness'
A police firearms officer, suspended from his role for refusing to shave his beard, has said he feels ""vindicated"" after an employment tribunal ruled he had been discriminated against. In 2017, the PSNI brought in a new health and safety policy requiring male officers to be clean shaven. Constable Gordon Downey claimed he had been discriminated against, a view supported by an employment tribunal.The PSNI said it is aware of the tribunal's findings.It added that it is currently examining the detail.
Speaking to BBC News NI, Constable Downey said: ""To be turfed out of the unit, with little or no notice, for refusal to shave off a moustache, which doesn't affect the equipment I've been issued with, is total madness."" NI police face tribunal over beard policyNew policies introduced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in 2017 resulted in a change regarding officers required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE) at short notice as part of their duties. The updated policy required these officers to ""remain clean shaven whilst on duty"" for health and safety reasons.""The policy itself was being enforced against men under health and safety grounds, and yet females within our unit had hair in contravention of the same policy, not facial hair but head hair, where there was a grab risk,"" Constable Downey said.""So the policy was being enforced against men and not against female officers."" Unanimous decision Constable Downey said he tried to be accommodating by shaving his beard to a moustache, but when he was asked to remove that he thought it was a step too far. ""As an older person with a receding hairline and alopecia who is slightly overweight all I can do is grow a bit of fur on my top lip, and to have that removed for absolutely no reason is wrong,"" he said.The unanimous decision of the tribunal was that Constable Downey was discriminated against contrary to the Sex Discrimination (NI) Order 1976.He was awarded just over £10,000 for hurt feelings and loss of earnings.

Solicitor Niall McMullan believes it is a significant ruling
Niall McMullan from Worthingtons Solicitors, who represented Constable Downey, said it was an important ruling. ""This is a significant ruling by the industrial tribunal, because it has essentially declared that the current PSNI policy is discriminating indirectly against males, in as far as the application of the policy is concerned,"" he said. ""I would like to see serious steps taken by the PSNI in relation to this decision.""The tribunal were unequivocal in so far as they want the PSNI to review this decision and to ensure it has a less discriminatory effect on not just my client, but all male officers who it is relevant to."""

The government has cut a tariff on lorries imported into the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The move comes after the Road Haulage Association (RHA) pushed the government to axe the tariff altogether.Instead, for the first year after the UK leaves the EU, the government will reduce the tariff from 22% to 10%.Lorries sold to the UK are currently not subject to a tariff, something the RHA says should continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit.RHA chief executive Richard Burnett said: ""The original proposal of a 22% tariff on HGVs coming in from the EU was unbelievable.
""A 10% tariff will still be crippling and will severely damage the lives and livelihoods of those responsible for operating the very industry that keeps the UK fit to live in.""The move is one of three amendments to the proposed tariff regime - originally published in March - that will come into force if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The Department for International Trade said the amendments include changes to tariffs on bioethanol imported into the UK. Also some clothing shipped into the UK will be taxed at between 8% and 12%. Both revisions are aimed at protecting domestic bioethanol and clothing producers from cheaper imports.The Department for International Trade said that under the temporary tariff regime, 88% of imports into the UK are eligible to be tariff-free for 12 months, up from the 87% it announced in March.'Difficulty'Commenting on the change to lorry import taxes, Meredith Crowley, an economist specialising in international trade from the University of Cambridge, said the UK's heavy goods vehicle sector is facing ""some difficulty with Brexit"".

She said: ""They were trying to have the same high tariffs on imports from the European Union but that could also raise prices for purchasers of heavy goods vehicles.""These vehicles are really expensive so £85,000 £100,000.""Meanwhile, a government paper on Monday found UK and EU firms would be faced with a ""a significant new and ongoing administrative burden"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It found large firms importing and exporting at scale would need to fill in forms taking one hour 45 minutes on average and cost £28 per form for each load imported."

The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and to support organs
No vaginal mesh implants have been carried out in Scotland since the chief medical officer announced a halt last October, new figures show.The government had asked health boards in June 2014 to consider suspending the use of mesh products but they had continued to be offered to women.  It followed controversy about the procedure which was often used to treat incontinence in women after childbirth. The number of alternative procedures has slowly risen since 2014.What's the issue with mesh implants?The figures, from October 2018 to March 2019, also show that over the past 10 years there has been a large decrease in the number of mesh procedures for stress urinary incontinence (SUI), particularly from 2014 onwards.
The number of non-mesh procedures for SUI has increased to a lesser extent and more gradually over the same period.What are mesh implants?
The mesh, usually made from synthetic polypropylene, is intended to repair damaged or weakened tissue
Over 20 years, more than 100,000 women across the UK had transvaginal mesh implants, which are used to treat pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI), often after childbirth
While the vast majority suffer no side-effects, the use of mesh in Scotland was suspended except in ""exceptional circumstances"" in 2014 after it emerged some women suffered painful side-effects

A No 10 source says a Brexit deal is ""essentially impossible"" after a call between the PM and Angela Merkel. Boris Johnson spoke to the German chancellor earlier about the proposals he put forward to the EU - but the source said she made clear a deal based on them was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"".Ms Merkel also said a deal would never be possible unless Northern Ireland stayed in a customs union, according to the source.They said it was a ""clarifying moment"".The source added: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down, despite the fact that the UK has moved a long way.""
Earlier, the UK government warned of a breakdown in talks with the EU before the week was out. A government official told the BBC the EU had not shown a desire to ""budge one centimetre"" since Mr Johnson submitted his proposals.They said a deal was not completely ruled out, but another source said the PM's plans were ""the only way out"". It comes after leaks from the European Commission showed major concerns from the EU about the UK's Brexit proposals.
PM calls on EU to 'thrash out' Brexit objections
Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit court move
What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
On Monday night, the Spectator published texts from a Downing Street source, who claimed if the deal ""dies in the next few days, then it won't be revived"".The government has not denied the briefing, which also said Mr Johnson ""will do all sorts of things to scupper a delay"" to leaving the EU, and that the UK may try to disrupt EU workings if forced to remain.Former Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd - who quit her job and the Conservative Party over the government's position on Brexit - said the language was ""angry and desperate"", and urged the prime minister to focus on getting ""clarity"" on a deal with ""dignity and diplomacy"". The cabinet are meeting this morning ahead of the final day of Parliament before it is suspended - or prorogued. It will return on Monday 14 October for the Queen's Speech - outlining the government's policies for the upcoming parliamentary session. The UK sent new proposals for a Brexit deal to Brussels last week, with Mr Johnson urging the EU to enter detailed talks to ""thrash out"" any objections. The main focus is to replace the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point with Parliament for agreeing a deal. Mr Johnson has said the UK will leave the EU on the Brexit deadline of 31 October, with or without a deal. But under legislation passed by MPs last month known, as the Benn Act, Mr Johnson must write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit.What are the PM's border plans?

Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
After presenting the plans to the EU, government sources hoped the UK might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October.Talks have been taking place between negotiators from both sides since Thursday evening and will continue today. But the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there is a growing expectation in government Brexit talks will fail before the week is out, claiming there is little sign of the EU being willing to engage in serious discussions about the UK proposals.  A senior source warned No 10 was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland or the plan of leaving the customs union.And if the EU does not accept these principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards the EU. In a final warning, government sources told Laura Kuenssberg the EU was heading for an ""historic miscalculation"" if they did not engage with the UK's proposals. What about the EU?

After receiving the proposals, the EU pledged to examine them carefully.But a number of senior figures, including Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar, warned the proposals did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done.French President Emanuel Macron said the EU would decide at the end of the week whether a new deal was possible. But a leaked presentation to EU diplomats revealed they were unwilling to accept the UK's plans committing to no checks on either side of the Irish border if the Northern Ireland Assembly - Stormont - is granted a veto and there is no guarantee of checks on the UK side.BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said EU negotiators were ""so nonplussed by the proposal they asked if it was a mistake"".It is understood the UK also wants continuing access to several EU trade databases, even if Stormont withholds its consent for the new arrangements.Warning from IFS and court challenge

While the negotiations between the UK and EU continue, a warning has been issued by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that even a ""relatively benign"" no-deal Brexit could push UK debt to its highest since the 1960s.In the report, the think tank said government borrowing was likely to rise to £100bn and total debt would soar to 90% of national income.The IFS's director, Paul Johnson, said the government was ""now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor"".But after the warning - directed at the chancellor as he prepares his annual budget - the Treasury said any decisions would be made ""with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances"".Another court case has also been launched to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is supporting three of its members to force the government to seek an extension to the deadline over fears their workers' rights would be watered down. The government has promised EU-law derived employment rights will remain in law after Brexit - such as minimum paid holiday and working hours regulations - but the union says ministers would have free rein to change them after the UK leaves the EU. The case follows a challenge in the High Court by civil rights group Liberty, which is seeking assurances that the government will abide by the Benn Act to seek an extension if no deal is agreed before 19 October.In Scotland, a separate challenge has been brought to the Inner House of the Court of Session - Scotland's highest court - by businessman Dale Vince, Jolyon Maugham QC and SNP MP Joanna Cherry, to  ask judges to consider whether a court can sign a Brexit extension request letter on behalf of the government.The court will also hear an appeal against a ruling, given on Monday, that Mr Johnson can be trusted to apply the law.

She told BBC Scotland it gave her ""peace of mind"".She has set-up a private clinic in Glasgow for others who want to pay for the vaccine but believes all teenage boys should be offered it on the NHS.Her view is echoed by experts who have said not offering a catch-up programme for all teenage boys could put thousands of lives at risk.
Boys' HPV vaccine 'to stop thousands of cancers'
What is HPV?
HPV vaccine for boys 'could cut cancer rates'
Dr Calder said: ""It became very apparent to me that there was lots of evidence that HPV vaccination is needed in boys as well as girls.""From 2008, the government has been vaccinating girls for cervical cancer and there's a recognised need for that and the programme has been very successful.""But what we realised for our boys was that there are other cancers which are also a risk, and they can hopefully be avoided by having the vaccination.""The GP admits that going private is a costly option but for her it was ""worth it"".She said: ""Unfortunately it's not a cheap vaccine. We've done it for both our boys and it's £155 per vaccine. If you are under 15 you need two vaccines but over 15 you need three of them. ""It gives us peace of mind that hopefully we have done all we can to try and prevent these horrible cancers.""AnalysisBy Lisa Summers, BBC Scotland Health Correspondent

The human papillomavirus is commonly spread through intimate contact. Most strains are harmless but in rare cases it can cause cancer. Links to cervical cancer are well known and that's why an HPV vaccination programme was introduced for girls over a decade ago. Evidence suggests it has dramatically reduced pre-cancerous cells in young women. But HPV has also been connected to other cancers and has been blamed for a sharp rise in cases of throat cancer. Scotland now has the highest incidence of these cancers in the UK. From this year S1 boys will be offered the vaccination. But dentists say that a catch up programme should be offered to all secondary school boys in the same way that all teenage girls can get the vaccination for free. They say thousands of boys will be at increased risk. But that would have cost implications and the Scottish government say the decision was made on UK expert advice. Information packs will soon be sent out to all S1 boys.

The vaccination is being offered to all boys in first year at secondary schools in Scotland
HPV is a leading cause of throat cancer and in Scotland cases of these cancers have almost trebled in recent years.Professor of dental public health at Glasgow University, David Conway, told BBC Scotland: ""Oropharyngeal cancer, throat cancer, is the most rapidly rising cancer in Scotland, and it's the HPV association that seems to be driving that change.""Dentists also think the decision not to offer a catch-up vaccination programme for older boys is a mistake.Dr David Cross, from the British Dental Association Scotland, said: ""Throat cancer is different in Scotland, there is a much higher rate of throat cancers associated with HPV infection and 75% of them are occurring in men so we think the boys need protection, and rolling out a catch-up programme will mean we can protect an additional 140,000 boys.""'You owe it to your son to protect him'

Professor Ian Frazer has been at the forefront of Australia's immunisation programme
The Scottish scientist who invented the HPV vaccine says there is ""no sensible argument"" against universal immunisation of boys and girls in schools.Prof Ian Frazer, who is based at the University of Queensland, has been at the forefront of Australia's immunisation programme since it was launched 2013.In the first year, all 12 to 15-year-old boys received three years' worth of catch-up vaccines. Now, all 12-year-old boys are offered the jab which Prof Frazer says loses effectiveness as boys get older.He said: ""The vaccine has been proven safe in trials worldwide and the only complication we have noticed is a very rare one-in-a-million allergic reaction to the vaccine.""There is no known downside to vaccination, apart of course from the cost which has to be met somehow. But the upside of saving significant numbers of lives is a real one. And it's an investment, not only for now but for the future, because all these cancers which could occur in the future could be prevented.""Sufficient fundsProf Frazer said he believed all parents ""owe it to your son to protect him as you would your daughter"".He added: ""It's more sensible to vaccinate one particular age cohort. It would be sensible to do a catch-up programme if there are sufficient funds available. If not, then the logical thing is just to do 12-year-olds.""The yield is less for every year past 12 you go. The cost-benefits analysis looks less good for every extra year. And by the time you've got to 17, it's down to a third of the benefit that you get from vaccinating 12-year-olds.""The Scottish government has encouraged all eligible boys to take up the offer of the HPV jab.A spokesman added: ""Vaccination policy in Scotland, as with the rest of the UK, is based on recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.""The JCVI has not recommended a catch-up approach for the HPV boys programme. Should that change, we will not hesitate to act and extend our programme.""'Potential risks'

Dr Calder has set up a private vaccination clinic in Glasgow
For Dr Calder, the important thing was to ensure her sons were protected and she said other parents who have come to her clinic have become more aware of the potential risks from not having the jab.She said: ""Often these are parents, unfortunately at the moment, who can afford to do it and know about it but the issue isn't as widely known as we'd like.""As a doctor working for the NHS, you always want to try and provide good health for the whole nation.""So it would be really good if we could get all boys vaccinated and try and eradicate some of these cancers."""

Extinction Rebellion protesters on the streets of London have been labelled ""uncooperative crusties"" by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The demonstrators - who are demanding action on climate change - should abandon their ""hemp-smelling bivouacs"" and stop blocking roads, the PM added.Police have already arrested more than 300 people at the start of two weeks of protests by environmental campaigners.Mr Johnson made the comments at a book launch on Monday evening.""I am afraid that the security people didn't want me to come along tonight because they said the road was full of uncooperative crusties and protesters of all kinds littering the road,"" he said.
""They said there was some risk that I would be egged.""

Boris Johnson is obliged to write to the EU requesting a Brexit delay if no deal is in place
Judges are to consider whether a court can sign a Brexit extension request letter on behalf of the government.The Inner House of the Court of Session, Scotland's highest court, is being asked to act directly if Boris Johnson refuses to request a delay.The letter is a key provision of what is known as the Benn Act, by which MPs hope to prevent a no-deal Brexit.The court will also hear an appeal against a ruling that Mr Johnson can be trusted to apply the law.Lord Pentland said following an earlier hearing that there could be ""no doubt"" that the prime minister had agreed to abide by the law.
As a result, he said there was no need for ""coercive orders"" against the UK government or against the prime minister.

And he said it would be ""destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the Crown"" if Mr Johnson reneged on his assurances to the court.The parallel case requesting that the court communicates directly with the European Union involves the exercise of the nobile officium power.This is described by the Judiciary of Scotland website as a mechanism by which ""the court may, within limits, mitigate the strictness of the law and provide a legal remedy where none exists"".The case has been brought by businessman Dale Vince, Jolyon Maugham QC and Joanna Cherry QC, who is an SNP MP.They argue that the court should step in to request a Brexit extension if the prime minister illegally refuses to do so.In such circumstances, a letter could be signed by an official of the court.What is the nobile officium?
The procedure of petitioning the nobile officium is unique to Scots law, but is far from being a forgotten backwater of the legal system.Its name is a Latin term meaning the ""noble office"".The procedure offers the opportunity to provide a remedy in a legal dispute where none exists.In other words, it can plug any gap in the law or offer mitigation if the law, when applied, would be seen to be too strict.Read more from home affairs correspondent Reevel AldersonWhat is the 'Benn Act'?Last month, MPs passed a law - introduced by Labour's Hilary Benn - designed to stop Boris Johnson pushing through a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.Under the law, MPs Mr Johnson is required to request a three-month Brexit delay by 19 October.There are two scenarios in which Mr Johnson would not have to request an extension:
MPs approve a Brexit deal in another meaningful vote
MPs vote in favour of leaving the EU without a deal
In either of these scenarios, Mr Benn's law would not force any Brexit extension to be requested."

A No 10 source says a Brexit deal is ""essentially impossible"" after a call between the PM and Angela Merkel. Boris Johnson spoke to the German chancellor earlier about the proposals he put forward to the EU - but the source said she made clear a deal based on them was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"".Ms Merkel also said a deal would never be possible unless Northern Ireland stayed in a customs union, according to the source.They said it was a ""clarifying moment"".The source added: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down, despite the fact that the UK has moved a long way.""
Earlier, the UK government warned of a breakdown in talks with the EU before the week was out. A government official told the BBC the EU had not shown a desire to ""budge one centimetre"" since Mr Johnson submitted his proposals.They said a deal was not completely ruled out, but another source said the PM's plans were ""the only way out"". It comes after leaks from the European Commission showed major concerns from the EU about the UK's Brexit proposals.
PM calls on EU to 'thrash out' Brexit objections
Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit court move
What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
On Monday night, the Spectator published texts from a Downing Street source, who claimed if the deal ""dies in the next few days, then it won't be revived"".The government has not denied the briefing, which also said Mr Johnson ""will do all sorts of things to scupper a delay"" to leaving the EU, and that the UK may try to disrupt EU workings if forced to remain.Former Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd - who quit her job and the Conservative Party over the government's position on Brexit - said the language was ""angry and desperate"", and urged the prime minister to focus on getting ""clarity"" on a deal with ""dignity and diplomacy"". The cabinet are meeting this morning ahead of the final day of Parliament before it is suspended - or prorogued. It will return on Monday 14 October for the Queen's Speech - outlining the government's policies for the upcoming parliamentary session. The UK sent new proposals for a Brexit deal to Brussels last week, with Mr Johnson urging the EU to enter detailed talks to ""thrash out"" any objections. The main focus is to replace the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point with Parliament for agreeing a deal. Mr Johnson has said the UK will leave the EU on the Brexit deadline of 31 October, with or without a deal. But under legislation passed by MPs last month known, as the Benn Act, Mr Johnson must write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit.What are the PM's border plans?

Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
After presenting the plans to the EU, government sources hoped the UK might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October.Talks have been taking place between negotiators from both sides since Thursday evening and will continue today. But the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there is a growing expectation in government Brexit talks will fail before the week is out, claiming there is little sign of the EU being willing to engage in serious discussions about the UK proposals.  A senior source warned No 10 was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland or the plan of leaving the customs union.And if the EU does not accept these principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards the EU. In a final warning, government sources told Laura Kuenssberg the EU was heading for an ""historic miscalculation"" if they did not engage with the UK's proposals. What about the EU?

After receiving the proposals, the EU pledged to examine them carefully.But a number of senior figures, including Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar, warned the proposals did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done.French President Emanuel Macron said the EU would decide at the end of the week whether a new deal was possible. But a leaked presentation to EU diplomats revealed they were unwilling to accept the UK's plans committing to no checks on either side of the Irish border if the Northern Ireland Assembly - Stormont - is granted a veto and there is no guarantee of checks on the UK side.BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said EU negotiators were ""so nonplussed by the proposal they asked if it was a mistake"".It is understood the UK also wants continuing access to several EU trade databases, even if Stormont withholds its consent for the new arrangements.Warning from IFS and court challenge

While the negotiations between the UK and EU continue, a warning has been issued by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that even a ""relatively benign"" no-deal Brexit could push UK debt to its highest since the 1960s.In the report, the think tank said government borrowing was likely to rise to £100bn and total debt would soar to 90% of national income.The IFS's director, Paul Johnson, said the government was ""now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor"".But after the warning - directed at the chancellor as he prepares his annual budget - the Treasury said any decisions would be made ""with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances"".Another court case has also been launched to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is supporting three of its members to force the government to seek an extension to the deadline over fears their workers' rights would be watered down. The government has promised EU-law derived employment rights will remain in law after Brexit - such as minimum paid holiday and working hours regulations - but the union says ministers would have free rein to change them after the UK leaves the EU. The case follows a challenge in the High Court by civil rights group Liberty, which is seeking assurances that the government will abide by the Benn Act to seek an extension if no deal is agreed before 19 October.In Scotland, a separate challenge has been brought to the Inner House of the Court of Session - Scotland's highest court - by businessman Dale Vince, Jolyon Maugham QC and SNP MP Joanna Cherry, to  ask judges to consider whether a court can sign a Brexit extension request letter on behalf of the government.The court will also hear an appeal against a ruling, given on Monday, that Mr Johnson can be trusted to apply the law.

The BBC's Brussels correspondent, Adam Fleming, said the German chancellery had not released their interpretation of the call, and it would be important to ""compare and contrast"".But he said an EU official close to the negotiations in Brussels had told him Mrs Merkel's reported comments did not reflect the EU's agreed position, adding: ""This is not our language.""

What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
Mr Johnson sent new proposals to Brussels last week, with the key focus being on replacing the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point. After presenting the plans, government sources hoped the UK might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October.But after the phone call, the No 10 source said it had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down, despite the fact that the UK has moved a long way.""  They said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals.The government argues allowing Stormont to approve part of the PM's plan is key to respecting the so-called ""principle of consent"" in the Good Friday Agreement, but Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has warned it could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole.'Scupper a delay'Mr Johnson has insisted the UK will leave the EU on the Brexit deadline of 31 October, with or without a deal. That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month known, as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. On Monday night, the Spectator published texts from a Downing Street source, who claimed if the deal ""dies in the next few days, then it won't be revived"".The government has not denied the briefing, which also said Mr Johnson ""will do all sorts of things to scupper a delay"" to leaving the EU.Earlier, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was a growing expectation in government Brexit talks would fail before the week was out.EU diplomats have told Adam Fleming there has been ""zero progress"" in the talks and in some areas they believe things are going backwards.What are the PM's border plans?

Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
What about the EU?

After receiving the proposals, the EU pledged to examine them carefully.But a number of senior figures, including Mr Varadkar, warned the proposals did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done.French President Emanuel Macron said the EU would decide at the end of the week whether a new deal was possible. But a leaked presentation to EU diplomats revealed they were unwilling to accept the UK's plans committing to no checks on either side of the Irish border if the Northern Ireland Assembly - Stormont - is granted a veto and there is no guarantee of checks on the UK side.BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said EU negotiators were ""so nonplussed by the proposal they asked if it was a mistake"".It is understood the UK also wants continuing access to several EU trade databases, even if Stormont withholds its consent for the new arrangements.

Productivity in the UK fell at its fastest annual pace in five years in the April-to-June quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics.The figure - measured by output per hour - fell by 0.5%, after two previous quarters of zero growth.Both services and manufacturing saw a fall from April to June, the ONS said.It added: ""This sustained period of declining labour productivity represents a continuation of the UK's 'productivity puzzle'."" The ONS added that productivity since the economic downturn in 2008 was ""growing more slowly than during the long period prior to downturn"".
Stagnant productivity 'costs workers £5,000 a year'
UK productivity continues lost decade
Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""These figures hammer home the impact uncertainty is having on the business environment.""Unsure of what's around the corner, businesses' investment in the new equipment and technology that drives up their performance has been stifled. Many companies are also trimming their investment pipelines for the year ahead to build up a cash cushion in anticipation of challenging economic conditions ahead.""Jon Boys, from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: ""Businesses may have more immediate concerns than raising productivity, but it's the only way to increase pay packets in the long term. ""We mustn't be fooled by recent strong earnings growth figures, which have been driven by a tight labour market and not an increase in employers' ability to pay.""Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, commented: ""Heightened concerns over Brexit - especially serious concerns among many companies of the UK leaving the EU without a deal - has clearly caused companies to limit their investment with damaging implications for productivity. ""If a Brexit deal is agreed and enacted by 31 October, this will hopefully dilute business uncertainty and provide some boost to business investment, which would be good news for productivity prospects."""

Three out of four lorries are predicted to turn up at Portsmouth ferry port without the right documentation in the wake of a no-deal Brexit.Customs documents needed by lorries crossing the English Channel will change in the event of a no-deal.Department for Transport (DfT) analysis suggests 75% will not be ""border ready"" and will be turned away.Hampshire and Isle of Wight's Local Resilience Forum has written to the government to express concerns.In a letter to the Secretary of State, the group described the impact of a lack of ""border-readiness"" by HGVs arriving at the port to sail to France or Spain as a ""major challenge"".

Simon Byrne took over the top job in the PSNI in June
The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland is ""coming after"" paramilitaries.Simon Byrne, who has been in the job for 100 days, said one of the force's priorities was tackling paramilitary crime.He said one his reasons for calling for more officers was ""to give people more confidence to come forward"".Mr Byrne said he wanted to ensure the police were ""the only legitimate power and control"" in communities.The challenges facing the new PSNI chief constable""I will use every power that's available to me and my officers both within criminal and civil law to dismantle your networks and put you in jail if you prey on communities,"" he told the BBC's Stephen Nolan.
""One of the big questions on people's lips is how such small numbers of people exercise such power and control over their communities and punish drug dealing and anti-social behaviour to show kind of legitimacy? We can't tolerate that.""It's one of the reasons I'm calling on more police officers because I think it will give people more confidence in communities to come forward and tell us who is pedalling drugs, extorting or causing harm.""The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) currently has 6,700 police officers and Mr Byrne said they were dealing with about 90 organised crime groups, across a number of nationalities.He said a review was under way into how ""to dismantle these people and organisations"" but it would take time ""to unpick the Mr Bigs"".

The bonfire at Avoniel Leisure Centre was part of the Eleventh Night celebrations
In July, Mr Byrne said the PSNI would ""not tolerate"" the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).The comments came after police told Belfast City Council the loyalist paramilitary group was involved with a controversial bonfire at Avoniel Leisure Centre.'Copycat violence'On Tuesday, he said the police's handling of the bonfire was based on a ""whole range of intelligence"".He said Northern Ireland was due to host The Open golf championship in Portrush and he had to think of the ""bigger picture"".""Did we want to get 'played' and get drawn into a conflict frankly about taking down a load of pallets which really should have been dealt with earlier?""The intelligence we had was there were elements, including the UVF but not specific to them, involved and there was a lot of emotion around what that bonfire meant to people, so had we gone in heavy-handed there could have been conflict.""It was about trying to see the bigger picture about how one issue could have led to copycat violence across Northern Ireland.""I didn't think the means justified the ends.""

Sabrina Lilley has described her experience of using a food bank
A working mother from Bangor, County Down, had to turn to a food bank to help feed her family when delays to her benefits left her in debt.Sabrina Lilley's marriage broke down in November last year changing her circumstances for working tax credits. She was moved to the new Universal Credit system but had to wait eight weeks for the money to come through.""I've never used a food bank so it was actually really hard to ask for help,"" she told BBC News NI.

Disabled people to get backdated benefit payments
""I usually keep things to myself but it got to the stage it was coming up to Christmas and I was struggling.""
Universal Credit combines six benefits into one single payment, including Housing Benefit and Jobseekers' Allowance. The idea is to taper benefits as people return to work removing the idea of a ""benefits trap"" where people are better off on benefits than in work.But many of those on Universal Credit are working and Ms Lilley is one of them.  She works 20 hours a week at a nursery and the sudden drop in income meant she had to increase her working hours to 30, but she feels her children have suffered as a result.""It's helping the wee ones with homework. I used to do that after school, but now it's closer to bed time and they're tired,"" she said.""I feel like I'm letting them down,"" she added.

Some local charities say they have seen an increase in the use of their services since the introduction of Universal Credit but not on the scale of their counterparts in Great Britain. Alison Blayney, who heads up the Kilcooley Women's Centre, said: ""The biggest impact we see is food poverty.""If people have been on benefits or a low income and find themselves without money for several weeks they often pay their other bills first and then find they have no money for food.""And because they have been on benefits there are no savings. ""It's not like they can say: 'I'll do my weekly shop on a Visa card'.""The Department for Communities, which is in charge of benefits payments, insists the system has been ""softer"" in Northern Ireland.

David Malcolm, a director of Universal Credit for the Department for Communities, said:  ""We started Universal Credit two years ago in Limavady.""Since then, we've had 75,000 claims made so we're learning every month. ""Nearly nine out of 10 people are being paid the right amount of money bang on the payment date, so we're getting a lot better at paying people .""We're getting a lot better at helping our more vulnerable customers and we're working in partnership with those who can help us reach out to those people who are still struggling."" 'Advanced payments'The five-week payment delay, which is part of the legislation, has been controversial on both sides of the Irish Sea.  But Mr Malcolm is quick to point out that people do not need to wait if they are financial difficulties: ""We offer advanced payments on the first day you make a claim.""If you need money and you need help you can get that on the very first day. ""People can make a claim for an advanced payment and usually they'll get an answer that day.""Universal Credit is also an online system for paying benefits. That can create difficulties for people who do not have great computer skills. Ms Lilley is computer savvy but still found it tricky: ""It took me about four hours to fill it in. You have to upload photographs of documents and if you don't have a good phone it can be difficult.""You also have an online diary where you can get in touch with the benefits office but it can be 48 hours before you get a response.""The DfC says most queries can be answered online but people can also visit a benefits office where advice is on hand.In the most recent statistics available for Universal Credit, more than 55% on the benefits are single with 34% lone parents. The average payment is £590 a month."

Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel spoke by phone on Tuesday mornign
Last week, the UK published new proposals designed to replace the backstop in the original withdrawal agreement, which would have kept the UK in a temporary customs territory with the EU.
Boris Johnson had rejected the backstop as ""anti-democratic"", putting forward a plan to take the whole of the UK out of the customs union.This would mean a new customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with new requirements for cross-border traders.The government has said it believes the impact of this can be minimised with any checks taking place away from the border.EU 'not interested'The Irish government and EU had not reacted positively to the proposals and said nothing yet had been put forward that fulfilled the objective of the backstop.On Tuesday, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the reported comments from Mrs Merkel revealed that the EU is ""not interested"" in a negotiated outcome.""The prime minister's proposals have flushed out Dublin's real intentions to trap Northern Ireland in the EU customs union forever, where Dublin rather than the United Kingdom's elected representatives would be in the driving seat,"" she said in a statement.""We will not accept any such ultimatum or outcome.""

""The British government, aided and abetted by the DUP...should set aside the Downing Street war games and finally listen to what people here are saying.""EU Council President Donald Tusk tweeted in response to the claim by the No 10 source, saying winning ""some stupid blame game"" was not what was at stake.

An EU official close to the negotiations told BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming Mrs Merkel's reported comments did not reflect the EU's agreed position, adding: ""This is not our language.""

Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit court move
What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
The PM has insisted the UK will leave the EU on the Brexit deadline of 31 October, with or without a deal. That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson sent new proposals for a deal to Brussels last week, with the key focus being on replacing the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point.

After presenting the new proposals to Brussels, government sources hoped the UK might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October.The EU pledged to examine them carefully, but a number of senior figures, including Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, warned the proposals did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done.French President Emanuel Macron said the EU would decide at the end of the week whether a new deal was possible. But after the phone call on Tuesday morning, the No 10 source said it had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down, despite the fact that the UK has moved a long way.""  Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
The source said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s - by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals, arguing the plan is key to respecting the so-called ""principle of consent"". But Mr Varadkar has warned the Johnson plan could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole.
It's not the official policy of the government yet...But in government and EU circles it is becoming more likely by the hour that there will not be an agreement at next week's EU council.There is no intention in Downing Street to move away from the broad concepts of what they are suggesting regarding either customs or the so-called principle of consent for gaining approval for the PM's plans from Northern Irish politicians.So short of a political escape worthy of Houdini, this prime minister is moving towards making the case for leaving without a deal.To their opponents, that might appear petulant and counter productive, but be in no doubt, if there is no deal this month, Boris Johnson's government would not suddenly play nice.And in the likely event that there is an extension, for political reasons No 10 wants to give the impression it was forced into that position.Read more from Laura here.
EU diplomats have told Adam Fleming there has been ""zero progress"" in the talks and in some areas they believe things are going backwards. A leaked presentation to diplomats on Monday revealed the EU would not accept the UK's plans committing to no checks on either side of the Irish border if the Northern Ireland Assembly was granted a veto and if there was no guarantee of checks on the UK side.Adam Fleming said EU negotiators were ""so nonplussed by the proposal they asked if it was a mistake"".It is understood the UK also wants continuing access to several EU trade databases, even if Stormont withholds its consent for the new arrangements.The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is still due to meet EU counterparts in Brussels on Tuesday, but another European official said he had so little room for manoeuvre, it called into question whether the UK was serious about getting a deal. On Monday night, the Spectator published texts from a Downing Street source, who claimed if the deal ""dies in the next few days, then it won't be revived"".The government has not denied the briefing, which also said Mr Johnson ""will do all sorts of things to scupper a delay"" to leaving the EU.

Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel spoke by phone on Tuesday mornign
Last week, the UK published new proposals designed to replace the backstop in the original withdrawal agreement, which would have kept the UK in a temporary customs territory with the EU.
Boris Johnson had rejected the backstop as ""anti-democratic"", putting forward a plan to take the whole of the UK out of the customs union.This would mean a new customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with new requirements for cross-border traders.The government has said it believes the impact of this can be minimised with any checks taking place away from the border.EU 'not interested'The Irish government and EU had not reacted positively to the proposals and said nothing yet had been put forward that fulfilled the objective of the backstop.On Tuesday, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the reported comments from Mrs Merkel revealed that the EU is ""not interested"" in a negotiated outcome.""The prime minister's proposals have flushed out Dublin's real intentions to trap Northern Ireland in the EU customs union forever, where Dublin rather than the United Kingdom's elected representatives would be in the driving seat,"" she said in a statement.""We will not accept any such ultimatum or outcome.""

However, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the detail of the phone call between the PM and German Chancellor showed that EU leaders are ""more in tune"" with people in Northern Ireland than Downing Street or the DUP.""Angela Merkel is right - retaining membership of the customs union and the single market is the only solution that prevents a hard border on this island,"" he said.""People here voted to remain in the customs union, we voted to retain the benefits of single market membership. ""The British government, aided and abetted by the DUP...should set aside the Downing Street war games and finally listen to what people here are saying.""EU Council President Donald Tusk tweeted in response to the claim by the No 10 source, saying winning ""some stupid blame game"" was not what was at stake.

In remote areas Post Offices can be the only places offering banking services
Barclays is facing criticism for opting out of part of the agreement banks have with Post Offices to allow customers to withdraw cash and deposit money.The move is seen as a threat to efforts to provide services to communities that have seen branches and ATMs disappear.Barclays will let its customers deposit money, but not withdraw cash from a Post Office counter using a debit card.Which? says it is a ""shocking decision"" which exposes the fragility of the UK's cash system. The Payment Systems Regulator, which oversees the cash system, warns it is ""concerned about the impact"".
Cashback schemeThe Post Office has unveiled a new agreement with 28 banks and building societies, covering the three years from January and allowing for postmasters and post mistresses to be paid more to take in and dispense cash.Barclays is the only one to exclude cash withdrawals from its part of the agreement.Instead it says it will launch a cashback scheme at small businesses in remote towns and areas where there is no branch or ATM alternative within 1km.
'Request an ATM' service to be launched
Pay by cash? Not for long, report warns
Barclays has also promised to freeze last-in-town and remote branch closures for two years. It says it is ""committed"" to its relationship with the Post Office because customers will still be able to deposit cash.Less choiceNatalie Ceeney, who wrote an Access to Cash Review this year, says Barclays customers make 1.2 million cash withdrawals from Post Offices every month.She is calling on the bank to reverse its plan for the sake of people who still rely heavily on cash, saying: ""The cash system that supports them must be cherished, not undermined.""The Payment Systems Regulator says the decision ""reduces the number of places their customers can go to get cash"", adding that it will be monitoring Barclays.Which? has been concerned about a drift towards a cashless society. It is calling for legislation that guarantees consumers can continue to access and pay with cash for as long as it is needed.The Post Office is clear that staff in its remote branches will get more money for handling banking transactions from January.Barclays' line is that opting out and finding alternatives will be more efficient. It says that 99% of its customers who use the Post Office are in an area where a branch or free-to-use cash machine is available as well."

Media captionGloomy post-Brexit forecasts 'accurate'
Even a ""relatively benign"" no-deal Brexit would push UK debt to its highest since the 1960s, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said.The think tank said borrowing was likely to rise to £100bn and total debt would soar to 90% of national income.""The government is now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson.The Treasury said any decisions would be made ""with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances"".Spending rulesThe gloomy forecasts are part of the IFS Green Budget, looking at the challenges facing Chancellor Sajid Javid as he prepares for his first Budget.
The IFS's Mr Johnson said: ""Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it [the government] should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways in any forthcoming Budget. ""In the case of a no-deal Brexit, though, it should be implementing carefully targeted and temporary tax cuts and spending increases where it can effectively support the economy.""
The next election: What will the parties promise?
A simple guide to Brexit
Will Johnson's Brexit plan work for business?
But even before the cost of a possible no-deal Brexit is factored in, the think tank said the government was set to break its own spending rules.The IFS forecasts that annual borrowing - the difference between what the government spends and what it receives through, for example, taxation - will top £50bn next year.That will be about 2.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of national income. Under current spending rules the government can only borrow up to 2% of national income.The think tank said the government's current plans for day-to-day spending next year are closer to the levels proposed by Labour's 2017 manifesto than plans laid out by the Conservative party at the time.An HM Treasury spokesperson said: ""September's spending round supported the people's priorities of health, education and the police within the existing fiscal rules, as we said it would be.""Beyond that, the chancellor has already said that we will be reviewing the fiscal framework as we turn the page on austerity. In so doing, we will retain a fiscal anchor to public spending so that decisions are taken with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances.""
A doubling in the annual budget deficit, leading, in relation to the size of the economy, to the highest government debt since the 1960s. These are the new forecasts of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies for how a no-deal Brexit is likely to drench the UK's public finances in red ink. Only on the extraordinary scale of the fiscal collapse of the 2008 financial crisis are these numbers modest. On any ordinary scale they do matter - an annual deficit heading back up towards £100bn, and national debt closer to 90% of GDP for the first time in half a century.And all this comes at a time where the institute concludes that the government is no longer taking its own fiscal rules seriously, borrowing more to spend more on public services even as the Treasury approaches its self-imposed limits.Read more here.
Growth warningIn the case of a no-deal Brexit, the IFS said a temporary government spending spree could help to smooth the path for growth, although it would also add to government debt.The think tank forecasts that the debt stock - the total amount of money owed by the government - would climb to almost 90% of national income. It currently stands at about 80%.Even with ""substantial"" government spending, the IFS expects the UK economy to flatline for two years following a no-deal Brexit.It warned that a rise in public spending in 2020 would likely be followed by ""another bust"" as the government would have to deal with ""the consequences of a smaller economy and higher debt for funding public services"".Mr Johnson said that it would be ""crucial"" that government spending programmes were temporary. ""An economy that turns out smaller than expected can, in the long run, support less public spending than expected, not more,"" he said.

Christian Schulz, the chief UK economist at Citi, which contributed to the report, said: ""The UK economy is already around £60bn smaller than it would have been without a vote to leave the European Union, with the UK missing out on a bout of global growth.""Business investment is up to 20% lower than it would otherwise have been, hurting productivity and wage growth,"" he said.However, Mr Schulz added that a further Brexit delay would create more uncertainty, denting investment and leaving growth at around 1% a year.""From a growth perspective, a Brexit deal is a little better, leaving growth at 1.5%, but it would leave no chance of Brexit being cancelled,"" he said.""A no-deal Brexit - even with a substantial stimulus - could mean no growth at all for the next two years. Remaining in the EU would be the best scenario for economic growth in the next few years."""

Police raided this flat in London at dawn on Tuesday
Police investigating what they say is the UK's biggest ever drugs conspiracy have arrested 13 men in dawn raids.The arrests follow an 18-month National Crime Agency investigation tracking drugs allegedly smuggled into the UK in lorry loads of vegetables and juice. The conspiracy was around the importation of more than 50 tonnes of drugs, worth millions of pounds, from the Netherlands, officers say.  NCA branch commander Jayne Lloyd called the arrests ""massively significant"". They were in:
London
Manchester, Stockport, Bolton, St Helens and Warrington, in Lancashire
Leeds and Dewsbury, in Yorkshire
""We believe it's the biggest ever conspiracy that we've seen in the UK,"" said Ms Lloyd, NCA regional head of investigations for the north of England.  The 13 are suspected of being part of the UK arm of a well established organised crime group that allegedly used Dutch and British front companies to import heroin, cocaine and cannabis. Four men and two women arrested in April by Dutch police, on a European Arrest Warrant, are awaiting extradition to the UK and are suspected of being part of the same conspiracy. The 13 men are alleged to have imported drugs on numerous occasions between February 2018 and October 2018, including three consignments intercepted in 2018 with a total street value of more than £38m.

Suffolk drugs raids lead to 18 arrests
""We suspect these men were involved in an industrial-scale operation - the biggest ever uncovered in the UK - bringing in tonnes of deadly drugs that were distributed to crime groups throughout the country,"" Ms Lloyd said.The investigation is linked to an operation in 2015 that saw 13 people jailed for a total of 176 years after the seizure of more than 100kg of heroin. Ms Lloyd said she hoped the arrests would ""have a big impact"" on the county lines drugs trade - in which drugs are transported form cities to users across the country - which was having a ""devastating effect on the public, vulnerable children and the economy"". The NCA says the investigation involved European police forces and agencies, including Europol, Eurojust, as well as the UK Border Force and Revenue & Customs.  ""By working closely with partners here and overseas, in particular the Dutch national police, we believe we have dismantled a well established drug supply route,"" Ms Lloyd said."

Developers say they will preserve ""large areas for wildlife""
Plans to build a further 1,200 homes at a site in Newcastle have been approved despite opposition.Formal planning permission for the expansion of Great Park has been issued by the city council and the scheme will also include the construction of two schools.Developers argue the properties are ""critical"" in order to meet the city's housing needs.Opponents warn they will devastate wildlife habitats.The application was first approved by councillors in December 2018, but a legal challenge by Save Newcastle's Wildlife and the introduction of new national planning rules led to delays.
The council and developers Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey have now signed a legal agreement triggering the formal planning permission, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Councillor Linda Hobson, cabinet member for housing, said the scheme was ""imperative"" to provide new homes in the city.She added the authority was confident it had followed a ""robust process"" and that the decision was ""lawfully made"".Persimmon said it had worked to minimise the impact on biodiversity and a package of measures had been agreed with Natural England.

Farmers will feel ""betrayed"" by a government plan not to impose tariffs on the majority of goods entering the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the National Farmers Union has said.The government has announced it will not tax 88% of imports into the UK.The NFU said without a Brexit deal its members face tariffs on exports while overseas rivals will not be taxed.""The Prime Minister has missed a real opportunity to back British farmers,"" said NFU chief Minette Batters.The government published its updated proposed tariff regime ahead of the UK's scheduled departure from the European Union on 31 October.
The regime, which will apply for the first year after the UK leaves the EU, contained three amendments including adjusting tariffs on bioethanol imports.Also some clothing shipped into the UK will be taxed at between 8% and 12%. Both revisions are aimed at protecting domestic bioethanol and clothing producers from cheaper imports.

What is a 'no-deal Brexit'?
Earlier this year, the government said it would introduce tariffs on some meat and dairy products shipped into the UK following a no-deal Brexit.However, its latest plans indicate 88% of UK imports will be tariff free if the country leaves the EU without a deal, up from 87% announced in March.Ms Batters said: ""We will see, from day one, farm businesses facing new, high tariffs on much of the 60% of our exports that go into the EU, while tariffs on goods coming into the UK will be set far, far lower and in many cases won't be applied at all.""She added: ""Farmers are going to feel betrayed by this government's failure to act now in making sure that all that can be done is being done to help mitigate the damaging effects of a no-deal Brexit.""Trade Policy Minister Conor Burns, said: ""Our temporary tariff regime will support the UK economy as a whole, helping British businesses to trade and opening up opportunities for business to import the best goods from around the world at the best prices for British consumers. ""   'Frictionless trade' Dairy UK, the trade body, said it had told the government earlier this year that ""this major liberalisation did not offer the level playing field this industry needs to survive"". ""Our preference is a deal,"" said Dairy UK's chief executive Judith Bryans. ""One which allows us to have open frictionless trade with our largest export customer, the EU. ""If that doesn't happen, the government needs to impose reciprocal tariffs to level the playing field and put in place a package of mitigation measures, before businesses are pushed to the wall.""The Department for International Trade also announced on Tuesday that a proposed 22% tariff on lorries sold into the UK would fall to 10%.

Lorries sold to the UK are currently not subject to a tariff, something the Road Haulage Association said should continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit.RHA chief executive Richard Burnett said: ""The original proposal of a 22% tariff on HGVs coming in from the EU was unbelievable.""A 10% tariff will still be crippling and will severely damage the lives and livelihoods of those responsible for operating the very industry that keeps the UK fit to live in.""Commenting on the change to lorry import taxes, Meredith Crowley, an economist specialising in international trade from the University of Cambridge, said the UK's heavy goods vehicle sector was facing ""some difficulty with Brexit"".She said: ""They were trying to have the same high tariffs on imports from the European Union but that could also raise prices for purchasers of heavy goods vehicles.""""These vehicles are really expensive, so £85,000 to £100,000.""Meanwhile, a government paper on Monday found UK and EU firms would be faced with a ""a significant new and ongoing administrative burden"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It found large firms importing and exporting at scale would need to fill in forms taking one hour 45 minutes on average and cost £28 per form for each load imported."

Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel spoke by phone on Tuesday mornign
Last week, the UK published new proposals designed to replace the backstop in the original withdrawal agreement, which would have kept the UK in a temporary customs territory with the EU.
Boris Johnson had rejected the backstop as ""anti-democratic"", putting forward a plan to take the whole of the UK out of the customs union.This would mean a new customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with new requirements for cross-border traders.The government has said it believes the impact of this can be minimised with any checks taking place away from the border.EU 'not interested'The Irish government and EU had not reacted positively to the proposals and said nothing yet had been put forward that fulfilled the objective of the backstop.On Tuesday, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the reported comments from Mrs Merkel revealed that the EU is ""not interested"" in a negotiated outcome.""The prime minister's proposals have flushed out Dublin's real intentions to trap Northern Ireland in the EU customs union forever, where Dublin rather than the United Kingdom's elected representatives would be in the driving seat,"" she said in a statement.""We will not accept any such ultimatum or outcome.""

A working mother from Bangor, County Down, had to turn to a food bank to help feed her family when delays to her benefits left her in debt.Sabrina Lilley's marriage broke down in November last year changing her circumstances for working tax credits. She was moved to the new Universal Credit system but had to wait eight weeks for the money to come through.""I've never used a food bank so it was actually really hard to ask for help,"" she told BBC News NI.

Disabled people to get backdated benefit payments
""I usually keep things to myself but it got to the stage it was coming up to Christmas and I was struggling.""
Universal Credit combines six benefits into one single payment, including Housing Benefit and Jobseekers' Allowance. The idea is to taper benefits as people return to work removing the idea of a ""benefits trap"" where people are better off on benefits than in work.But many of those on Universal Credit are working and Ms Lilley is one of them.  She works 20 hours a week at a nursery and the sudden drop in income meant she had to increase her working hours to 30, but she feels her children have suffered as a result.""It's helping the wee ones with homework. I used to do that after school, but now it's closer to bed time and they're tired,"" she said.""I feel like I'm letting them down,"" she added.

Some local charities say they have seen an increase in the use of their services since the introduction of Universal Credit but not on the scale of their counterparts in Great Britain. Alison Blayney, who heads up the Kilcooley Women's Centre, said: ""The biggest impact we see is food poverty.""If people have been on benefits or a low income and find themselves without money for several weeks they often pay their other bills first and then find they have no money for food.""And because they have been on benefits there are no savings. ""It's not like they can say: 'I'll do my weekly shop on a Visa card'.""The Department for Communities, which is in charge of benefits payments, insists the system has been ""softer"" in Northern Ireland.

David Malcolm, a director of Universal Credit for the Department for Communities, said:  ""We started Universal Credit two years ago in Limavady.""Since then, we've had 75,000 claims made so we're learning every month. ""Nearly nine out of 10 people are being paid the right amount of money bang on the payment date, so we're getting a lot better at paying people .""We're getting a lot better at helping our more vulnerable customers and we're working in partnership with those who can help us reach out to those people who are still struggling."" 'Advanced payments'The five-week payment delay, which is part of the legislation, has been controversial on both sides of the Irish Sea.  But Mr Malcolm is quick to point out that people do not need to wait if they are financial difficulties: ""We offer advanced payments on the first day you make a claim.""If you need money and you need help you can get that on the very first day. ""People can make a claim for an advanced payment and usually they'll get an answer that day.""Universal Credit is also an online system for paying benefits. That can create difficulties for people who do not have great computer skills. Ms Lilley is computer savvy but still found it tricky: ""It took me about four hours to fill it in. You have to upload photographs of documents and if you don't have a good phone it can be difficult.""You also have an online diary where you can get in touch with the benefits office but it can be 48 hours before you get a response.""The DfC says most queries can be answered online but people can also visit a benefits office where advice is on hand.In the most recent statistics available for Universal Credit, more than 55% on the benefits are single with 34% lone parents. The average payment is £590 a month."

Productivity in the UK fell at its fastest annual pace in five years in the April-to-June quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics.The figure - measured by output per hour - fell by 0.5%, after two previous quarters of zero growth.Both services and manufacturing saw a fall from April to June, the ONS said.It added: ""This sustained period of declining labour productivity represents a continuation of the UK's 'productivity puzzle'."" The ONS added that productivity since the economic downturn in 2008 was ""growing more slowly than during the long period prior to downturn"".
No-deal Brexit 'to push UK debt to 50-year high'
Stagnant productivity 'costs workers £5,000 a year'
Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""These figures hammer home the impact uncertainty is having on the business environment.""Unsure of what's around the corner, businesses' investment in the new equipment and technology that drives up their performance has been stifled. Many companies are also trimming their investment pipelines for the year ahead to build up a cash cushion in anticipation of challenging economic conditions ahead.""
Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondentYou could argue that there is an upside to Britain's poor recent productivity performance - the amount of output you get from each worker, sometimes per year or sometimes per hour. It means you need more people to produce a certain amount of goods and services than you would have done, had productivity been higher. Britain now has the highest percentage of the population in employment since at least 1971 (that's how far back this particular data series goes). Perhaps that wouldn't have been true if productivity had been better. And the benefits of higher productivity when you get it aren't necessarily evenly shared. It's not really that much comfort though. In the long term, rising living standards need rising productivity. There's a limit to what can be achieved by having more people do more work. There's a well-known line from the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman on this: ""Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country's ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.""
Jon Boys, from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: ""Businesses may have more immediate concerns than raising productivity, but it's the only way to increase pay packets in the long term. ""We mustn't be fooled by recent strong earnings growth figures, which have been driven by a tight labour market and not an increase in employers' ability to pay.""Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, commented: ""Heightened concerns over Brexit - especially serious concerns among many companies of the UK leaving the EU without a deal - has clearly caused companies to limit their investment with damaging implications for productivity. ""If a Brexit deal is agreed and enacted by 31 October, this will hopefully dilute business uncertainty and provide some boost to business investment, which would be good news for productivity prospects."""

What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
The PM has insisted the UK will leave the EU on the Brexit deadline of 31 October, with or without a deal. That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson sent new proposals for a deal to Brussels last week, with the key focus being on replacing the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point.

Media captionConfused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics
After presenting the new proposals, government sources hoped the UK might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October.The EU pledged to examine them carefully, but a number of senior figures, including Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, warned they did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done.French President Emanuel Macron said the EU would decide at the end of the week whether a new deal was possible. But after the phone call on Tuesday morning, the No 10 source said it had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down, despite the fact that the UK has moved a long way.""
No-one really wants to comment directly on this phone call - certainly not Berlin. But talking to EU officials and diplomats in Brussels, there is considerable scepticism.That's because the words attributed to Angela Merkel do not reflect the EU's agreed language. For one, Mrs Merkel and the EU have repeatedly said they will keep talking to the last second and will not pull the plug before that. And secondly, the No 10 source claims the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland permanently ""trapped"" in the customs union - Brussels insists it doesn't want that at all, it just wants the option for Northern Ireland stay inside temporarily until something else is worked out.So as I say, scepticism. It could be a misinterpretation or it could be a deliberate bit of spin, because we're now entering into a blame game about whose fault it is that progress isn't being made.
Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
The No 10 source said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s - by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals, arguing the plan is key to respecting the so-called ""principle of consent"". But Mr Varadkar has warned the Johnson plan could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole.
It's not the official policy of the government yet...But in government and EU circles it is becoming more likely by the hour that there will not be an agreement at next week's EU council.There is no intention in Downing Street to move away from the broad concepts of what they are suggesting regarding either customs or the so-called principle of consent for gaining approval for the PM's plans from Northern Irish politicians.So short of a political escape worthy of Houdini, this prime minister is moving towards making the case for leaving without a deal.To their opponents, that might appear petulant and counter productive, but be in no doubt, if there is no deal this month, Boris Johnson's government would not suddenly play nice.And in the likely event that there is an extension, for political reasons No 10 wants to give the impression it was forced into that position.Read more from Laura here.
EU diplomats have told Adam Fleming there has been ""zero progress"" in the talks and in some areas they believe things are going backwards. A presentation to diplomats, leaked on Monday, revealed the EU would not accept the UK's plans committing to no checks on either side of the Irish border if the Northern Ireland Assembly was granted a veto and if there was no guarantee of checks on the UK side.Negotiators were ""so nonplussed by the proposal they asked if it was a mistake"", our correspondent added.The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is still due to meet EU counterparts in Brussels on Tuesday, but another European official said he had so little room for manoeuvre, it called into question whether the UK was serious about getting a deal. On Monday night, the Spectator published texts from a Downing Street source, who claimed if the deal ""dies in the next few days, then it won't be revived"".The government has not denied the briefing, which also said Mr Johnson ""will do all sorts of things to scupper a delay"" to leaving the EU.

Police investigating what they say is the UK's biggest ever drugs conspiracy have arrested 13 men in dawn raids.The arrests follow an 18-month National Crime Agency investigation tracking drugs allegedly smuggled into the UK in lorry loads of vegetables and juice. The conspiracy was around the importation of more than 50 tonnes of drugs, worth millions of pounds, from the Netherlands, officers say.  NCA branch commander Jayne Lloyd called the arrests ""massively significant"". They were in:
London
Manchester, Stockport, Bolton, St Helens and Warrington, in Lancashire
Leeds and Dewsbury, in Yorkshire
""We believe it's the biggest ever conspiracy that we've seen in the UK,"" said Ms Lloyd, NCA regional head of investigations for the north of England.  The 13 are suspected of being part of the UK arm of a well established organised crime group that allegedly used Dutch and British front companies to import heroin, cocaine and cannabis. Four men and two women arrested in April by Dutch police, on a European Arrest Warrant, are awaiting extradition to the UK and are suspected of being part of the same conspiracy. The 13 men are alleged to have imported drugs on numerous occasions between February 2018 and October 2018, including three consignments intercepted in 2018 with a total street value of more than £38m.

""We suspect these men were involved in an industrial-scale operation - the biggest ever uncovered in the UK - bringing in tonnes of deadly drugs that were distributed to crime groups throughout the country,"" Ms Lloyd said.The investigation is linked to an operation in 2015 that saw 13 people jailed for a total of 176 years after the seizure of more than 100kg of heroin. Ms Lloyd said she hoped the arrests would ""have a big impact"" on the county lines drugs trade - in which drugs are transported form cities to users across the country - which was having a ""devastating effect on the public, vulnerable children and the economy"". The NCA says the investigation involved European police forces and agencies, including Europol, Eurojust, as well as the UK Border Force and Revenue & Customs.  ""By working closely with partners here and overseas, in particular the Dutch national police, we believe we have dismantled a well established drug supply route,"" Ms Lloyd said."

Farmers will feel ""betrayed"" by a government plan not to impose tariffs on the majority of goods entering the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the National Farmers Union has said.The government has announced it will not tax 88% of imports into the UK.The NFU said without a Brexit deal its members face tariffs on exports while overseas rivals will not be taxed.""The Prime Minister has missed a real opportunity to back British farmers,"" said NFU chief Minette Batters.The government published its updated proposed tariff regime ahead of the UK's scheduled departure from the European Union on 31 October.
The regime, which will apply for the first year after the UK leaves the EU, contained three amendments including adjusting tariffs on bioethanol imports.Also some clothing shipped into the UK will be taxed at between 8% and 12%. Both revisions are aimed at protecting domestic bioethanol and clothing producers from cheaper imports.

What is a 'no-deal Brexit'?
Earlier this year, the government said it would introduce tariffs on some meat and dairy products shipped into the UK following a no-deal Brexit.However, its latest plans indicate 88% of UK imports will be tariff free if the country leaves the EU without a deal, up from 87% announced in March.Ms Batters said: ""We will see, from day one, farm businesses facing new, high tariffs on much of the 60% of our exports that go into the EU, while tariffs on goods coming into the UK will be set far, far lower and in many cases won't be applied at all.""She added: ""Farmers are going to feel betrayed by this government's failure to act now in making sure that all that can be done is being done to help mitigate the damaging effects of a no-deal Brexit.""Trade Policy Minister Conor Burns, said: ""Our temporary tariff regime will support the UK economy as a whole, helping British businesses to trade and opening up opportunities for business to import the best goods from around the world at the best prices for British consumers. ""   'Frictionless trade' Dairy UK, the trade body, said it had told the government earlier this year that ""this major liberalisation did not offer the level playing field this industry needs to survive"". ""Our preference is a deal,"" said Dairy UK's chief executive Judith Bryans. ""One which allows us to have open frictionless trade with our largest export customer, the EU. ""If that doesn't happen, the government needs to impose reciprocal tariffs to level the playing field and put in place a package of mitigation measures, before businesses are pushed to the wall.""The Department for International Trade also announced on Tuesday that a proposed 22% tariff on lorries sold into the UK would fall to 10%.

Lorries sold to the UK are currently not subject to a tariff, something the Road Haulage Association said should continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit.RHA chief executive Richard Burnett said: ""The original proposal of a 22% tariff on HGVs coming in from the EU was unbelievable.""A 10% tariff will still be crippling and will severely damage the lives and livelihoods of those responsible for operating the very industry that keeps the UK fit to live in.""Commenting on the change to lorry import taxes, Meredith Crowley, an economist specialising in international trade from the University of Cambridge, said the UK's heavy goods vehicle sector was facing ""some difficulty with Brexit"".She said: ""They were trying to have the same high tariffs on imports from the European Union but that could also raise prices for purchasers of heavy goods vehicles.""""These vehicles are really expensive, so £85,000 to £100,000.""Meanwhile, a government paper on Monday found UK and EU firms would be faced with a ""a significant new and ongoing administrative burden"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It found large firms importing and exporting at scale would need to fill in forms taking one hour 45 minutes on average and cost £28 per form for each load imported."

Officially, the prime minister's spokesman said the talks - aimed at securing an agreement at next week's EU summit - were ""at a crucial point"", but denied they were over.Scotland's First Minister and leader of the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon, said Downing Street's response to the phone call was an ""attempt to shift the blame for the Brexit fiasco"".

That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. The key focus of the new UK plans is to replace the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point.  After presenting them, government sources hoped the sides might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of talks almost immediately, but a number of senior EU figures, including Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, warned they did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done.The No 10 source said Tuesday morning's phone call - which was not discussed at cabinet - had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down, despite the fact that the UK has moved a long way.""
No-one really wants to comment directly on this phone call - certainly not Berlin. But talking to EU officials and diplomats in Brussels, there is considerable scepticism.That's because the words attributed to Angela Merkel do not reflect the EU's agreed language. For one, Mrs Merkel and the EU have repeatedly said they will keep talking to the last second and will not pull the plug before that. And secondly, the No 10 source claims the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland permanently ""trapped"" in the customs union - Brussels insists it doesn't want that at all, it just wants the option for Northern Ireland stay inside temporarily until something else is worked out.So as I say, scepticism. It could be a misinterpretation or it could be a deliberate bit of spin, because we're now entering into a blame game about whose fault it is that progress isn't being made.
Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
The No 10 source said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s - by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals, arguing the plan is key to respecting the so-called ""principle of consent"". But Mr Varadkar has warned the Johnson plan could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole.
It's not the official policy of the government yet...But in government and EU circles it is becoming more likely by the hour that there will not be an agreement at next week's EU council.There is no intention in Downing Street to move away from the broad concepts of what they are suggesting regarding either customs or the so-called principle of consent for gaining approval for the PM's plans from Northern Irish politicians.So short of a political escape worthy of Houdini, this prime minister is moving towards making the case for leaving without a deal.To their opponents, that might appear petulant and counter productive, but be in no doubt, if there is no deal this month, Boris Johnson's government would not suddenly play nice.And in the likely event that there is an extension, for political reasons No 10 wants to give the impression it was forced into that position.Read more from Laura here.
A presentation to diplomats, leaked on Monday, revealed the EU would not accept the UK's plans committing to no checks on either side of the Irish border if the Northern Ireland Assembly was granted a veto and if there was no guarantee of checks on the UK side.Negotiators were ""so nonplussed by the proposal they asked if it was a mistake"", Adam Fleming added.The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is meeting EU counterparts in Brussels on Tuesday, but another European official said he had so little room for manoeuvre, it called into question whether the UK was serious about getting a deal. On Monday night, the Spectator published texts from a Downing Street source, who claimed if the deal ""dies in the next few days, then it won't be revived"".The government has not denied the briefing, which also said Mr Johnson ""will do all sorts of things to scupper a delay"" to leaving the EU.

There has been little sign of progress in talks between the two sides since Mr Johnson sent new proposals for a deal to Brussels last week, with the EU demanding ""fundamental changes"".
Latest on Brexit deal talks
Is no-deal about to become PM's policy?
PM calls on EU to 'thrash out' Brexit objections
Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit court move
What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
Officially, the prime minister's spokesman said the talks - aimed at securing an agreement at next week's EU summit - were ""at a crucial point"", but denied they were over.Scotland's First Minister and leader of the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon, said Downing Street's response to the phone call was an ""attempt to shift the blame for the Brexit fiasco"". And Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told MPs the government was ""intent on collapsing the talks and engaging in a reckless blame game"".""The stark reality is the government put forward proposals that were designed to fail,"" he said, adding that it was ""beneath contempt"" that, according to a Downing Street source reported by the Spectator, the UK could withdraw security co-operation from other EU countries if it were forced to remain beyond 31 October.The PM has insisted the UK will leave the EU on that date, with or without a deal.

Media captionConfused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics
That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. The key focus of the new UK plans is to replace the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point.  After presenting them, government sources hoped the sides might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of talks almost immediately, but a number of senior EU figures, including Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, warned they did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done.The No 10 source said Tuesday morning's phone call - which was not discussed at cabinet - had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down, despite the fact that the UK has moved a long way.""
No-one really wants to comment directly on this phone call - certainly not Berlin - but talking to EU officials and diplomats in Brussels, there is considerable scepticism.That's because the words attributed to Angela Merkel do not reflect the EU's agreed language. For one, Mrs Merkel and the EU have repeatedly said they will keep talking to the last second and will not pull the plug before that. And secondly, the No 10 source claims the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland permanently ""trapped"" in the customs union - Brussels insists it doesn't want that at all, it just wants the option for Northern Ireland stay inside temporarily until something else is worked out.So as I say, scepticism. It could be a misinterpretation or it could be a deliberate bit of spin, because we're now entering into a blame game about whose fault it is that progress isn't being made.
Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
The No 10 source said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s - by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals, arguing the plan is key to respecting the so-called ""principle of consent"". But Mr Varadkar has warned the Johnson plan could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole.
It's not the official policy of the government yet...But in government and EU circles it is becoming more likely by the hour that there will not be an agreement at next week's EU council.There is no intention in Downing Street to move away from the broad concepts of what they are suggesting regarding either customs or the so-called principle of consent for gaining approval for the PM's plans from Northern Irish politicians.So short of a political escape worthy of Houdini, this prime minister is moving towards making the case for leaving without a deal.To their opponents, that might appear petulant and counter productive, but be in no doubt, if there is no deal this month, Boris Johnson's government would not suddenly play nice.And in the likely event that there is an extension, for political reasons No 10 wants to give the impression it was forced into that position.Read more from Laura here.
A presentation to diplomats, leaked on Monday, revealed the EU would not accept the UK's plans committing to no checks on either side of the Irish border if the Northern Ireland Assembly was granted a veto and if there was no guarantee of checks on the UK side.Negotiators were ""so nonplussed by the proposal they asked if it was a mistake"", Adam Fleming added.The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is meeting EU counterparts in Brussels on Tuesday, but another European official said he had so little room for manoeuvre, it called into question whether the UK was serious about getting a deal.

In remote areas Post Offices can be the only places offering banking services
Barclays is facing criticism for opting out of part of the agreement banks have with Post Offices to allow customers to withdraw cash and deposit money.The move is seen as a threat to efforts to provide services to communities that have seen branches and ATMs disappear.Barclays will let its customers deposit money, but not withdraw cash from a Post Office counter using a debit card.Consumer association Which? says it is a ""shocking decision"" which exposes the fragility of the UK's cash system. The Payment Systems Regulator, which oversees the cash system, warned it was ""concerned about the impact"", while Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee, called the decision ""unjustifiable"", adding that Barclays needs to ""think again"".
Cashback schemeThe Post Office has unveiled a new agreement with 28 banks and building societies, covering the three years from January and allowing for postmasters and post mistresses to be paid more to take in and dispense cash.Barclays is the only one to exclude cash withdrawals from its part of the agreement.Instead it says it will launch a cashback scheme at small businesses in remote towns and areas where there is no branch or ATM alternative within 1km.
'Request an ATM' service to be launched
Pay by cash? Not for long, report warns
Barclays has also promised to freeze last-in-town and remote branch closures for two years. It says it is ""committed"" to its relationship with the Post Office because customers will still be able to deposit cash.Less choiceNatalie Ceeney, who wrote an Access to Cash Review this year, says Barclays customers make 1.2 million cash withdrawals from Post Offices every month.She is calling on the bank to reverse its plan for the sake of people who still rely heavily on cash, saying: ""The cash system that supports them must be cherished, not undermined.""The Payment Systems Regulator says the decision ""reduces the number of places their customers can go to get cash"", adding that it will be monitoring Barclays.Ms Reeves said: ""This decision comes at a time when, across the banking sector, High Street branches are closing and free cashpoints are under threat.""It's essential that the future viability of the Post Office network is secured and unfortunately this decision from Barclays suggests they are forgetting their wider social responsibilities."" Which? has been concerned about a drift towards a cashless society. It is calling for legislation that guarantees consumers can continue to access and pay with cash for as long as it is needed.The Post Office is clear that staff in its remote branches will get more money for handling banking transactions.Barclays' line is that opting out and finding alternatives will be more efficient. It says that 99% of its customers who use the Post Office are in an area where a branch or free-to-use cash machine is available as well."

Trade and customs experts have given MPs sharply differing opinions on the government's Brexit plan for the Irish border.The plan would involve a new customs border, albeit one where checks and controls happen away from the border.Shanker Singham, who has advised pro-Brexit groups, said that the government had found an ""elegant solution"".Sam Lowe, from the pro-EU Centre for European Reform, said the plan was not appropriate for a post-conflict region.The experts were addressing MPs sitting on Westminster's Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday.

Under the government's plan checks would happen away from the border
Mr Singham said that would create ""two half borders"", with the most intrusive regulatory checks dealt with in Irish Sea ports.He also supported the government's plan for widespread use of trusted traders schemes and customs exemptions for the smallest businesses.He said that if there were to be a deal the Irish government would have to move from its view that there could be no new checks or controls anywhere on the island of Ireland.""There is no way of achieving that unless Northern Ireland stays in the single market and customs union,"" he said.""Unless people come off that view it's very hard to see how any deal could work.""'Random stops and checks'Mr Lowe said he ""admires the honesty"" of the government finally admitting that Northern Ireland would have to continue to align with some EU rules to prevent a harder border.But on customs he said that ""the goalposts are moved"" from what the EU and UK agreed in the 2017 Joint Report, which was a sort of interim deal.He said the UK customs plan would involve infrastructure and new systems.""How do you ensure people who don't recognise the legitimacy of the new system will comply with it... how much does the British government want to stress test the region?"" he asked.He also suggested the government plan would have to involve random stopping and checking of some vehicles.Customs expert Dr Anna Jerzewska said much of the commentary about the government's plan appeared to underestimate the complexity of correctly preparing customs declarations.The plan would involve submitting documents electronically but she said the point was not how customs documents are submitted but rather the information they must contain.She said it takes ""time and specialised knowledge"" and there was a lack of trained customs professionals in the UK."

Some fishermen feel the increased number of checks on smaller boats is putting them under pressure
Fishermen using small fishing boats based in English ports have said they are frustrated at increasing amounts of inspections in preparation for Brexit.The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is extending surveillance to ""deter and detect illegal fishing by any vessels in English waters"".The extra checks are being done in port and at sea using boats and aircraft. Fishermen based in Newlyn, Cornwall said ""we feel under so much scrutiny that people have given up"".The MMO said the changes would bring vessels under 10m in line with other fishing boats around the coastline.

Newlyn is one of the largest fishing ports in England with the highest number of fishermen
Fisherman Nigel Taylor said: ""The MMO were rarely around but now all of sudden they are in force and it is rubbing a few people up the wrong way. ""They haven't enforced landings all this time while we have been in the European Union and when they should have been enforcing Spanish boats, French boats, Belgian boats landing in the ports. Now with the local boats they are all over them - it is crazy.""Landing obligations are designed to protect fish stocks and apply to species that are managed by quota limits.The fishermen have always been subject to the regulations but say the regular checks are adding increased pressure.The MMO said it had ""strengthened its capabilities... to get ready for the UK becoming an independent coastal state after Brexit.""This includes ""an increase in personnel, vessels and aerial patrols to deter and detect illegal fishing by any vessels in English waters and to provide reassurance to hard working fishermen,"" it added.It is also introducing the recording of catches for the under-10m fleet to give a ""clearer picture"" of the fish being taken from the sea."

Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo
The parents of a teenage motorcyclist killed in a crash have said ""we will go to Washington if we have to"", to secure the return of a US diplomat's wife suspected of driving the other vehicle. Harry Dunn, 19, died in a crash with a Volvo in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Anne Sacoolas, a suspect in the crash, later left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged the US to reconsider its decision to allow her immunity.Meanwhile, both Northamptonshire's chief constable and police and crime commissioner have urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity.
'Appalled and devastated'Tim Dunn, Harry's father, told the BBC: ""With Boris Johnson saying what he did, it was nice to feel actually we were getting the support we were trying to get. ""Maybe President Trump will look at this and hopefully look in our favour.""Harry's mother, Charlotte Charles, said: ""We have spoken to some American news channels, we've got others lined up. The message is clearly getting out across there.""The messages of support we've had from the US have been immense. They're all appalled and devastated for us and disgusted that this woman has been allowed to leave the UK.""

Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles have spoken to US media about their case
Ms Charles said: ""We are determined to see it through, we won't stop. We will go to Washington if we have to, we've taken [legal] advice on that.""She said they would ""plead"" to President Trump to not only waive Ms Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity, but also ""look at the laws"" around diplomatic immunity""With the amount of diplomats we have in the UK, we can't have someone go out and do something like that again and leave another family to suffer,"" she added.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, has spoken to the US ambassador Woody Johnson, and raised the case in a telephone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.A Foreign Office spokesman said Mr Raab had ""reiterated his disappointment with the US decision and urged them to reconsider"".
What happened to Harry Dunn?Harry Dunn died after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a black Volvo XC90 at about 20:30 BST on B4031 Park End in Croughton close to the RAF base, on Tuesday, 27 August.He was taken to Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where he died a short time later.Northamptonshire's chief constable Nick Adderley said that ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew that ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"".He said the suspect, Anne Sacoolas had ""engaged fully"" following the crash and said ""she had no plans to leave the country in the near future"".
What is diplomatic immunity? About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship. It is granted by the 1961 Vienna Convention and means that, in theory, diplomats cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. The convention also states that those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. Where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity where they feel it is appropriate. In 2017, there were 12 serious offences committed by people entitled to diplomatic protection.Five of these were driving related, but other crimes included sexual assault, blackmail and possession of a firearm.Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.Anne Sacoolas's husband is fully covered, as she is, because of agreement between the US and the UK that he and many others have diplomatic status.
How is the story being covered in the US?Imtiaz Tyab, Correspondent CBS NewsThe US is going through some pretty extraordinary times at the moment. But somehow this story has really struck a chord with many Americans and I think that is because at its heart you have two parents grieving the loss of their son.What's also so different about this story is this idea of diplomatic immunity.That doesn't sit right with a lot of people we've been hearing from either commenting on our reports or through social media.Many of them say Anne Sacoolas should be back in the UK and should meet with the family of Harry Dunn."

Dry ice could save rail passengers from delays by removing leaves from the tracks, researchers have said.Every autumn, about 50 million leaves land on the UK's railway lines, making them slippery and forcing trains to go slower, Network Rail has said.The rail operator added leaves were ""like black ice"" to trains and cost the industry £345m each year.Engineers at the University of Sheffield have developed dry ice for removing leaves from the line.More Yorkshire stories
The rail operator will test dry ice on five UK routes this autumn.These include: Stocksbridge, South Yorkshire, and Sutton Park, West Midlands, for freight; and Blackpool, West Highlands and Swansea passenger services.

Network Rail said ""few things annoy customers more than trains delayed because of leaves on the line""
When trains run over leaves they become compacted and smooth, causing trains to lose their grip.A Network Rail spokesman described them as ""the rail equivalent of black ice on the roads"".Currently, a mix of sand and steel particles is sprayed on the tracks, from water tanks mounted on trains, to rid them of leaves.

The University of Sheffield's cryogenic method, developed with Icetech Technologies, uses dry ice pellets.They are blasted onto the tracks with air which causes the leaves to freeze and become brittle.The pellets then turn back into gas and increase in size, blasting the leaves off the line, the university said.Professor Roger Lewis said the method means ""more predictable braking and traction than current technology"" and does not damage the wheels or rails, as trains are not required to carry heavy water tanks.

Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo
The parents of a teenage motorcyclist killed in a crash have said ""we will go to Washington if we have to"", to secure the return of a US diplomat's wife suspected of driving the other vehicle. Harry Dunn, 19, died in a crash with a Volvo in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Anne Sacoolas, a suspect in the crash, later left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged the US to reconsider its decision to allow her immunity.Meanwhile, both Northamptonshire's chief constable and police and crime commissioner have urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity.
'Appalled and devastated'Tim Dunn, Harry's father, told the BBC: ""With Boris Johnson saying what he did, it was nice to feel actually we were getting the support we were trying to get. ""Maybe President Trump will look at this and hopefully look in our favour.""Harry's mother, Charlotte Charles, said: ""We have spoken to some American news channels, we've got others lined up. The message is clearly getting out across there.""The messages of support we've had from the US have been immense. They're all appalled and devastated for us and disgusted that this woman has been allowed to leave the UK.""

Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles have spoken to US media about their case
Ms Charles said: ""We are determined to see it through, we won't stop. We will go to Washington if we have to, we've taken [legal] advice on that.""She said they would ""plead"" to President Trump to not only waive Ms Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity, but also ""look at the laws"" around diplomatic immunity""With the amount of diplomats we have in the UK, we can't have someone go out and do something like that again and leave another family to suffer,"" she added.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, has spoken to the US ambassador Woody Johnson, and raised the case in a telephone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.A Foreign Office spokesman said Mr Raab had ""reiterated his disappointment with the US decision and urged them to reconsider"".
What happened to Harry Dunn?Harry Dunn died after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a black Volvo XC90 at about 20:30 BST on B4031 Park End in Croughton close to the RAF base, on Tuesday, 27 August.He was taken to Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where he died a short time later.Northamptonshire's chief constable Nick Adderley said that ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew that ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"".He said the suspect, Anne Sacoolas had ""engaged fully"" following the crash and said ""she had no plans to leave the country in the near future"".
What is diplomatic immunity? About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship. It is granted by the 1961 Vienna Convention and means that, in theory, diplomats cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. The convention also states that those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. Where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity where they feel it is appropriate. In 2017, there were 12 serious offences committed by people entitled to diplomatic protection.Five of these were driving related, but other crimes included sexual assault, blackmail and possession of a firearm.Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.Anne Sacoolas's husband is fully covered, as she is, because of agreement between the US and the UK that he and many others have diplomatic status.
How is the story being covered in the US?Imtiaz Tyab, Correspondent CBS NewsThe US is going through some pretty extraordinary times at the moment. But somehow this story has really struck a chord with many Americans and I think that is because at its heart you have two parents grieving the loss of their son.What's also so different about this story is this idea of diplomatic immunity.That doesn't sit right with a lot of people we've been hearing from either commenting on our reports or through social media.Many of them say Anne Sacoolas should be back in the UK and should meet with the family of Harry Dunn."

Boris Johnson is at odds with Parliament on the issue of leaving the EU without a deal
Boris Johnson has repeatedly said the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October. However, should the PM fail to strike a Brexit deal by 19 October, a law passed by MPs says the PM must extend the deadline.So what exactly is this law and how might the government try to get round it?What does the Brexit extension law say? In September MPs passed a new law - introduced by Labour's Hilary Benn - designed to stop Mr Johnson pushing through a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.Under the ""Benn Act"", Mr Johnson would be required to request a three-month Brexit delay unless he can pass a deal or get MPs to approve a no-deal exit by 19 October.However, despite the new law, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss insists Brexit will still happen at the end of the month:
""We'll leave without a deal. That's clear - deal or no deal, we're leaving on the 31st"", she told the BBC.So what possible options might the government be looking at?

Image caption
Labour MP Hilary Benn's bill sets the length of any further extension to three months
Two lettersThe law would force the prime minister to request the extension via a letter - it even sets out the exact wording.One idea that has been floated is for Mr Johnson to follow the rules but write a second letter, telling EU countries that he actually does not want an extension.This could lead EU countries to decide not to grant the extension as it would be clear it is not what the UK government actually wants.In this scenario it is possible the EU could simply ignore the second letter and just grant the extension.Persuade someone to rejectAny extension to the Brexit deadline would have to be agreed to by all EU member states. So, theoretically, Mr Johnson could comply with the law by writing the letter, but persuade just one country to veto it.

Boris Johnson would be required to send a letter to Donald Tusk
But persuading a country to side with the departing UK over their European neighbours could be a long shot.MPs vote for no deal or reject an EU extensionThe prime minister would avoid having to send any letter if MPs vote in favour of a no-deal Brexit by 19 October. This is almost impossible as there is no majority in Parliament for this.In another scenario, the EU grants an extension but proposes a date other than 31 January 2020. If that happens, MPs would have the power to reject the proposal, therefore leaving us heading towards a no-deal exit.

Image caption
An election is on the cards but the prime minister would still have the power to choose the date
Ignore the law and wait for the courtsThe most simple option for the prime minister is to sit on his hands and refuse to write a letter. This would almost certainly lead to legal action and constitutional experts have suggested he would face almost certain defeat.Mr Johnson could bank on the legal process taking over 12 days to complete, which would take him past the Brexit deadline before being forced to ask for an extension,Refuse to resignOne option open to MPs who oppose a no-deal Brexit is to defeat the government in a vote of no confidence. In this scenario, an alternative government could emerge and take over from Mr Johnson if it can prove it has the confidence of a majority of MPs.By convention, Mr Johnson would visit the Queen to resign and recommend the appointment of whoever the leader of the alternative government is.In theory, he could refuse to leave and become a squatter behind the black door of No 10. This could put the Queen in an unprecedented position as she may be forced to sack him.

Report
Last week, the UK published new proposals designed to replace the backstop in the original withdrawal agreement, which would have kept the UK in a temporary customs territory with the EU.Mr Johnson had rejected the backstop as ""anti-democratic"", putting forward a plan to take the whole of the UK out of the customs union.That would mean a new customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with new requirements for cross-border traders.The UK government has said it believes the impact of that can be minimised with any checks taking place away from the border.But the Irish government and the EU did not reacted positively to the proposals.
Analysis: Has hope of a Brexit deal died?By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporterGiven the ramped-up political blame game that seems to have been taking place in recent days it's perhaps not surprising that this is where things have gotten to.The DUP remains firmly on the side of Number 10, insisting detail from the phone call proves the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland in a customs union ""forever"".Compare that with what the Irish government and EU say about needing fair proposals from Downing Street and a ""willing"" negotiating partner.It would seem the obstacles are intractable but don't rule anything out yet.Deal, delay and no-deal are all still possible options, much to the concern of other Stormont parties and businesses in Northern Ireland waiting for a clear way forward.
At Stormont on Tuesday, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) clashed with other Northern Ireland political parties about attempts to get a Brexit deal.DUP leader Arlene Foster said the reported comments from Mrs Merkel revealed that the EU was ""not interested"" in a negotiated outcome.""The prime minister's proposals have flushed out Dublin's real intentions to trap Northern Ireland in the EU customs union forever, where Dublin rather than the United Kingdom's elected representatives would be in the driving seat,"" she added.""We will not accept any such ultimatum or outcome.""

In 2017, the government's flagship treatment scheme for people convicted in England and Wales of rape or child sexual abuse was scrapped after it was shown to raise the risk of reoffending. Two sex offenders have told BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme what it was like to take part in the rehabilitation programme.  ""Everything was discussed in minute detail. They had what was called the 'hot seat' and every prisoner that was in a group had to sit in the hot seat and they were bombarded - it was like an interrogation.""  These are Paul's experiences of group sessions on the discredited Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP), which ran from the early 1990s until 2017.Paul has been convicted of numerous offences, including rape, and is serving a long jail sentence. Speaking to me from a prison pay-phone, he says he started the SOTP on three occasions - it was a cognitive behaviour therapy designed to teach offenders to think and act differently.
But, the 60-year-old says, each time, he was removed from the course before the end because group facilitators thought he ""wasn't learning anything"".'Deviant thoughts'""Being in group settings, discussing serious offences and some less serious offences - because these groups were mixed - actually made prisoners worse and normalised what prisoners were doing,"" he says.Rapists, murderers, child sex offenders and ""flashers"" were all placed together, says Paul. ""People were learning from their mistakes - they were learning from other group members how to perhaps be better sex offenders without being caught."" Ministry of Justice (MoJ) research showed 10% of men who had completed the SOTP reoffended, compared with 8% of those who had not done the programme.

Kathryn Hopkins's research revealed those who went on the SOTP were more likely to reoffend.
The results were published five years after analyst Kathryn Hopkins first alerted the department the scheme might not be working.  Paul also claims some inmates were told to disclose the names of their victims as part of the process of setting out their offending history in graphic detail.""It was to physically humiliate you and break you - I could see no other purpose for it,"" he says.Many of Paul's observations are shared by Dr Robert Forde, a retired forensic psychologist who used to work for the Home Office and is an expert on assessing risk.Sexual practices Dr Forde told File on 4: ""One prisoner said to me, 'I hate doing this course because I've never had so many deviant sexual thoughts as I've had since I started because we're talking about sex offending all the time and actually I want to get away from all that.'""Another prisoner, who had himself been a victim of sex abuse as a child, told him he had been asked to give details of what had happened to him in front of paedophiles who had became aroused as a result. Dr Forde some prisoners on the SOTP courses would ""play the system"" in order to convince the Parole Board they were safe to be released.He said one prisoner had told him: ""You claim to have things like deviant thoughts about victims or indulge in deviant sexual practices and then after the course is finished and you're doing the post-course assessment, you then drop all these things and you just tell the truth."" The inmate claimed this would then result in the prisoner being given a lower risk score by course assessors.  'Booster' courseFormer prisoner Peter, who has served two sentences for sexual offences against children and possessing indecent images, tells me the SOTP provided a false sense of security.""You come out thinking you're fixed,"" he says.""There's that feeling... because it's a treatment programme and that's what treatment does, doesn't it - fixes what's wrong?""Now in his 50s, Peter had to do a ""booster"" course when he was first released.""You're going back over the offences, so you keep reliving this stuff that just isn't helpful,"" he says.""You're not going to forget what you've done and you know you've made victims... if you're going to be a useful member of society, you need to try and move your life forward."" Groundbreaking projectDuring his second spell in jail, Peter completed one-to-one sessions as part of the Healthy Sex Programme, which he found far more beneficial because it focused less on his offending and more on steps to overcome his problems.He is now receiving support at the Corbett Centre, a groundbreaking project in Nottingham run by the Safer Living Foundation Charity. It provides a range of emotional help and practical support for about 30 sex offenders living in the community. ""You're in an environment where people know what's happened,"" Peter says.""So you're not having to start your life with a lie... you can put your life back on track."" Although the Corbett Centre shows some promising early signs, it will be some years before it is known whether it reduces reoffending in the long term.'Causing harm'A number of Ministry of Justice initiatives are also unproven - the Healthy Sex Programme is currently being evaluated, while the two sex offender rehabilitation schemes that replaced the SOTP, Horizon and Kaizen, have yet to be tested.The MoJ says it works ""closely"" with the Correctional Services Accreditation and Advice Panel in the design of programmes delivered in prison and on probation. The department says the panel, which has to approve such schemes before they can be used, is made up of ""independent experts from academia and practice from across the world"". But two forensic psychiatrists, Penny Brown and Callum Ross, have been so alarmed by the failings in the SOTP programme they are calling for greater oversight of new forms of treatment.This week, the Lancet Psychiatry medical journal published a paper they have written.""We want to get reassurance that government-funded policy research is subjected to the same requirements and high academic standards that are placed on everybody else and all other scientists,"" says Dr Brown.""The need to show that you're doing something shouldn't override the risk of actually causing harm.""File on 4 is on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on 8 October and 17:00 on 13 October and BBC Sounds."

Paschal Donohoe says Brexit and climate change are the two main risks to the Irish economy
The Irish finance minister has unveiled a cautious budget for 2020 on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit.Growth next year, predicted to be close to about 5.5% this year, will be much slower if the UK crashes out of the EU, said Paschal Donohoe.He promised a contingency fund of €1.2bn (£1.07bn) for ""at-risk"" sectors such as agriculture and tourism.He pleaded for understanding considering ""the shadow of Brexit"" cast over his calculations.
Brexit deal 'possible but not at any cost'
No-deal Brexit 'could cut 50,000 Irish jobs'
The contingency fund would require borrowing but the minister said if there was a Brexit deal he would not approach lenders.
The Republic of Ireland already has a debt pile of over €200bn (£176bn), which is mainly the result of the 2008 property-related economic crash and the resulting bank bail-out.Fuel price increase expectedIn his opening remarks on Tuesday, Mr Donohoe said there were two risks to the Irish economy - Brexit and climate change.To respond to the climate challenge he announced that the carbon tax would increase by €6 (£5.38) a tonne from midnight on Tuesday.That amount is too small for many green activists but has been criticised by Sinn Féin and left-wing parties for disproportionately affecting the less well-off.The increase is expected to result in an increase of between one and two cents in diesel and petrol at the fuel pumps.

Motortion
In 2017, the government's flagship treatment scheme for people convicted in England and Wales of rape or child sexual abuse was scrapped after it was shown to raise the risk of reoffending. Two sex offenders have told BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme what it was like to take part in the rehabilitation programme.  ""Everything was discussed in minute detail. They had what was called the 'hot seat' and every prisoner that was in a group had to sit in the hot seat and they were bombarded - it was like an interrogation.""  These are Paul's experiences of group sessions on the discredited Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP), which ran from the early 1990s until 2017.Paul has been convicted of numerous offences, including rape, and is serving a long jail sentence. Speaking to me from a prison pay-phone, he says he started the SOTP on three occasions - it was a cognitive behaviour therapy designed to teach offenders to think and act differently.
But, the 60-year-old says, each time, he was removed from the course before the end because group facilitators thought he ""wasn't learning anything"".'Deviant thoughts'""Being in group settings, discussing serious offences and some less serious offences - because these groups were mixed - actually made prisoners worse and normalised what prisoners were doing,"" he says.Rapists, murderers, child sex offenders and ""flashers"" were all placed together, says Paul. ""People were learning from their mistakes - they were learning from other group members how to perhaps be better sex offenders without being caught."" Ministry of Justice (MoJ) research showed 10% of men who had completed the SOTP reoffended, compared with 8% of those who had not done the programme.
Image caption
Kathryn Hopkins's research revealed those who went on the SOTP were more likely to reoffend.
The results were published five years after analyst Kathryn Hopkins first alerted the department the scheme might not be working.  Paul also claims some inmates were told to disclose the names of their victims as part of the process of setting out their offending history in graphic detail.""It was to physically humiliate you and break you - I could see no other purpose for it,"" he says.Many of Paul's observations are shared by Dr Robert Forde, a retired forensic psychologist who used to work for the Home Office and is an expert on assessing risk.Sexual practices Dr Forde told File on 4: ""One prisoner said to me, 'I hate doing this course because I've never had so many deviant sexual thoughts as I've had since I started because we're talking about sex offending all the time and actually I want to get away from all that.'""Another prisoner, who had himself been a victim of sex abuse as a child, told him he had been asked to give details of what had happened to him in front of paedophiles who had became aroused as a result. Dr Forde said some prisoners on the SOTP courses would ""play the system"" in order to convince the Parole Board they were safe to be released.He said one prisoner had told him: ""You claim to have things like deviant thoughts about victims or indulge in deviant sexual practices and then after the course is finished and you're doing the post-course assessment, you then drop all these things and you just tell the truth."" The inmate claimed this would then result in the prisoner being given a lower risk score by course assessors.  'Booster' courseFormer prisoner Peter, who has served two sentences for sexual offences against children and possessing indecent images, tells me the SOTP provided a false sense of security.""You come out thinking you're fixed,"" he says.""There's that feeling... because it's a treatment programme and that's what treatment does, doesn't it - fixes what's wrong?""Now in his 50s, Peter had to do a ""booster"" course when he was first released.""You're going back over the offences, so you keep reliving this stuff that just isn't helpful,"" he says.""You're not going to forget what you've done and you know you've made victims... if you're going to be a useful member of society, you need to try and move your life forward."" Groundbreaking projectDuring his second spell in jail, Peter completed one-to-one sessions as part of the Healthy Sex Programme, which he found far more beneficial because it focused less on his offending and more on steps to overcome his problems.He is now receiving support at the Corbett Centre, a groundbreaking project in Nottingham run by the Safer Living Foundation Charity. It provides a range of emotional help and practical support for about 30 sex offenders living in the community. ""You're in an environment where people know what's happened,"" Peter says.""So you're not having to start your life with a lie... you can put your life back on track."" Although the Corbett Centre shows some promising early signs, it will be some years before it is known whether it reduces reoffending in the long term.'Causing harm'A number of Ministry of Justice initiatives are also unproven - the Healthy Sex Programme is currently being evaluated, while the two sex offender rehabilitation schemes that replaced the SOTP, Horizon and Kaizen, have yet to be tested.The MoJ says it works ""closely"" with the Correctional Services Accreditation and Advice Panel in the design of programmes delivered in prison and on probation. The department says the panel, which has to approve such schemes before they can be used, is made up of ""independent experts from academia and practice from across the world"". But two forensic psychiatrists, Penny Brown and Callum Ross, have been so alarmed by the failings in the SOTP programme they are calling for greater oversight of new forms of treatment. This week, the Lancet Psychiatry medical journal published a paper they have written.""We want to get reassurance that government-funded policy research is subjected to the same requirements and high academic standards that are placed on everybody else and all other scientists,"" says Dr Brown.""The need to show that you're doing something shouldn't override the risk of actually causing harm.""File on 4 is on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on 8 October and 17:00 on 13 October and BBC Sounds."

Paschal Donohoe says Brexit and climate change are the two main risks to the Irish economy
The Irish finance minister has unveiled a cautious budget for 2020 on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit.Growth next year, predicted to be close to about 5.5% this year, will be much slower if the UK crashes out of the EU, said Paschal Donohoe.He promised a contingency fund of €1.2bn (£1.07bn) for ""at-risk"" sectors such as agriculture and tourism.He pleaded for understanding considering ""the shadow of Brexit"" cast over his calculations.
Brexit deal 'possible but not at any cost'
No-deal Brexit 'could cut 50,000 Irish jobs'
The contingency fund would require borrowing but the minister said if there was a Brexit deal he would not approach lenders.
The Republic of Ireland already has a debt pile of over €200bn (£176bn), which is mainly the result of the 2008 property-related economic crash and the resulting bank bail-out.Fuel price increase expectedIn his opening remarks on Tuesday, Mr Donohoe said there were two risks to the Irish economy - Brexit and climate change.To respond to the climate challenge he announced that the carbon tax would increase by €6 (£5.38) a tonne from midnight on Tuesday.That amount is too small for many green activists but has been criticised by Sinn Féin and left-wing parties for disproportionately affecting the less well-off.The increase is expected to result in an increase of between one and two cents in diesel and petrol at the fuel pumps.

Last week, the UK published new proposals designed to replace the backstop in the original withdrawal agreement, which would have kept the UK in a temporary customs territory with the EU.Mr Johnson had rejected the backstop as ""anti-democratic"", putting forward a plan to take the whole of the UK out of the customs union.That would mean a new customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with new requirements for cross-border traders.The UK government has said it believes the impact of that can be minimised with any checks taking place away from the border.But the Irish government and the EU did not reacted positively to the proposals.
Analysis: Has hope of a Brexit deal died?By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporterGiven the ramped-up political blame game that seems to have been taking place in recent days it's perhaps not surprising that this is where things have gotten to.The DUP remains firmly on the side of Number 10, insisting detail from the phone call proves the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland in a customs union ""forever"".Compare that with what the Irish government and EU say about needing fair proposals from Downing Street and a ""willing"" negotiating partner.It would seem the obstacles are intractable but don't rule anything out yet.Deal, delay and no-deal are all still possible options, much to the concern of other Stormont parties and businesses in Northern Ireland waiting for a clear way forward.
At Stormont on Tuesday, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) clashed with other Northern Ireland political parties about attempts to get a Brexit deal.DUP leader Arlene Foster said the reported comments from Mrs Merkel revealed that the EU was ""not interested"" in a negotiated outcome.""The prime minister's proposals have flushed out Dublin's real intentions to trap Northern Ireland in the EU customs union forever, where Dublin rather than the United Kingdom's elected representatives would be in the driving seat,"" she added.""We will not accept any such ultimatum or outcome.""

Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is continuing to meet EU counterparts in Brussels, but the No 10 source said Tuesday morning's phone call had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down."" They said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland, or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s - by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals.
Hands up if all this stuff about ""spokesman"" and ""sources"" is driving you bonkers? Here's the in-brief explanation of how it works at Westminster.The prime minister has an official spokesman. They work for the government, not the political party that is in government. They give two briefings a day to reporters when Parliament is sitting and they are on the record. That is to say we report what is said and we report who said it - although by convention we don't actually name the spokesman.There are two reasons for this: they are speaking on behalf of the PM, not themselves. And sometimes a deputy does the briefing instead. In addition to the official spokesman, there are other people in Downing Street who will talk to journalists. For some, that is their specific job. For others, it is not.These people will always talk to us off the record - so we can quote them, but not name them, or do anything that risks identifying them.Journalists always prefer on the record quotes, but in politics as in life, people are often more candid in private, and so we can get a greater sense of what is going on in return for respecting the terms on which the information has been given to us.
Updating MPs on contingency planning for a no-deal exit, cabinet minister Michael Gove said there was still ""every chance"" of a deal but the EU must engage with the UK's plans.""In setting out these proposals, we've moved - it is now time for the EU to move too,"" he said.Ireland's Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister), Simon Coveney, said a deal was still possible but ""not any at cost"" - and the UK must accept it had ""responsibilities"" on the island of Ireland.

The UK and Irish leaders spoke on the phone for 40 minutes on Tuesday, after which No 10 said both sides ""strongly reiterated"" their desire to reach a deal.But Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told MPs the government was ""intent on collapsing the talks and engaging in a reckless blame game"".""The stark reality is the government put forward proposals that were designed to fail,"" he said, adding that it was ""beneath contempt"" that, according to a Downing Street source reported by the Spectator, the UK could withdraw security co-operation from other EU countries if it were forced to remain beyond 31 October.
How could no-deal happen?
Brexit deal possible but not at any cost - Coveney
Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit court move
What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
The PM has insisted the UK will leave the EU on that date, with or without a deal.  That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit.
No-one really wants to comment directly on this phone call - certainly not Berlin - but talking to EU officials and diplomats in Brussels, there is considerable scepticism.That's because the words attributed to Angela Merkel do not reflect the EU's agreed language. For one, Mrs Merkel and the EU have repeatedly said they will keep talking to the last second and will not pull the plug before that. And secondly, the No 10 source claims the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland permanently ""trapped"" in the customs union - Brussels insists it doesn't want that at all, it just wants the option for Northern Ireland stay inside temporarily until something else is worked out.So as I say, scepticism. It could be a misinterpretation or it could be a deliberate bit of spin, because we're now entering into a blame game about whose fault it is that progress isn't being made.
The key focus of the new UK plans is to replace the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point.  After presenting them, government sources hoped the sides might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of talks almost immediately, but a number of senior EU figures, including Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, warned they did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done.Mr Varadkar has warned the Johnson plan could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole.

Mr Johnson spoke to the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar in a phone call on Tuesday evening, with both men reiterating ""their desire to reach a Brexit deal"", according to an Irish government spokesman.Last week, the UK published new proposals designed to replace the backstop in the original withdrawal agreement, which would have kept the UK in a temporary customs territory with the EU.Mr Johnson had rejected the backstop as ""anti-democratic"", putting forward a plan to take the whole of the UK out of the customs union.That would mean a new customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with new requirements for cross-border traders.The UK government has said it believes the impact of that can be minimised with any checks taking place away from the border.But the Irish government and the EU did not react positively to the proposals.
Analysis: Has hope of a Brexit deal died?By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporterGiven the ramped-up political blame game that seems to have been taking place in recent days it's perhaps not surprising that this is where things have gotten to.The DUP remains firmly on the side of Number 10, insisting detail from the phone call proves the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland in a customs union ""forever"".Compare that with what the Irish government and EU say about needing fair proposals from Downing Street and a ""willing"" negotiating partner.It would seem the obstacles are intractable but don't rule anything out yet.Deal, delay and no-deal are all still possible options, much to the concern of other Stormont parties and businesses in Northern Ireland waiting for a clear way forward.
At Stormont on Tuesday, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) clashed with other Northern Ireland political parties about attempts to get a Brexit deal.DUP leader Arlene Foster said the reported comments from Mrs Merkel revealed the EU was ""not interested"" in a negotiated outcome.""The prime minister's proposals have flushed out Dublin's real intentions to trap Northern Ireland in the EU customs union forever, where Dublin rather than the United Kingdom's elected representatives would be in the driving seat,"" she added.""We will not accept any such ultimatum or outcome.""

Arlene Foster says it is unacceptable for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said EU leaders were ""more in tune"" with people in Northern Ireland than the UK government or the DUP.""The British government, aided and abetted by the DUP... should set aside the Downing Street war games and finally listen to what people here are saying,"" he added.

Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said Northern Ireland was sitting on the ""brink of a no-deal disaster"".""Politicians in the EU and our own government are treating Northern Ireland like a chess piece in a very high risk game,"" he said.""The UK government is more interested in a game of 'he said, she said' than producing a viable alternative.""Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith distanced himself from a Downing Street briefing about the state of the Brexit negotiations.In a piece published in the Spectator, a source claimed EU countries that supported another extension to the Brexit deadline would go to ""the bottom of the queue"" on future co-operation, including on defence and security matters.Mr Smith tweeted that ""any threat on withdrawing security co-operation with Ireland is unacceptable"".

With efforts to get a deal by the end of the month on an apparent knife edge, Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar have said they hope to meet later in the week.Amid frantic diplomatic manoeuvring in European capitals, details of a call earlier on Tuesday between the UK and German leaders have reignited tensions across the continent. The No 10 source suggested Mrs Merkel told her counterpart the only way to break the deadlock was for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and for it to permanently accept EU single market rules on trade in goods.

Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is continuing to meet EU counterparts in Brussels, but the No 10 source said Tuesday morning's phone call had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down."" They said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland, or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s - by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals.
Hands up if all this stuff about ""spokesman"" and ""sources"" is driving you bonkers? Here's the in-brief explanation of how it works at Westminster.The prime minister has an official spokesman. They work for the government, not the political party that is in government. They give two briefings a day to reporters when Parliament is sitting and they are on the record. That is to say we report what is said and we report who said it - although by convention we don't actually name the spokesman.There are two reasons for this: they are speaking on behalf of the PM, not themselves. And sometimes a deputy does the briefing instead. In addition to the official spokesman, there are other people in Downing Street who will talk to journalists. For some, that is their specific job. For others, it is not.These people will always talk to us off the record - so we can quote them, but not name them, or do anything that risks identifying them.Journalists always prefer on the record quotes, but in politics as in life, people are often more candid in private, and so we can get a greater sense of what is going on in return for respecting the terms on which the information has been given to us.
Updating MPs on contingency planning for a no-deal exit, cabinet minister Michael Gove said there was still ""every chance"" of a deal but the EU must engage with the UK's plans.""In setting out these proposals, we've moved - it is now time for the EU to move too,"" he said.Ireland's Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister), Simon Coveney, said a deal was still possible but ""not any at cost"" - and the UK must accept it had ""responsibilities"" on the island of Ireland.

What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
The PM has insisted the UK will leave the EU on that date, with or without a deal.  That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit.
No-one really wants to comment directly on this phone call - certainly not Berlin - but talking to EU officials and diplomats in Brussels, there is considerable scepticism.That's because the words attributed to Angela Merkel do not reflect the EU's agreed language. For one, Mrs Merkel and the EU have repeatedly said they will keep talking to the last second and will not pull the plug before that. And secondly, the No 10 source claims the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland permanently ""trapped"" in the customs union - Brussels insists it doesn't want that at all, it just wants the option for Northern Ireland stay inside temporarily until something else is worked out.So as I say, scepticism. It could be a misinterpretation or it could be a deliberate bit of spin, because we're now entering into a blame game about whose fault it is that progress isn't being made.
The key focus of the new UK plans is to replace the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point.  After presenting them, government sources hoped the sides might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of talks almost immediately, but a number of senior EU figures, including Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, warned they did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done.Mr Varadkar has warned the Johnson plan could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole.

Stagnant productivity 'costs workers £5,000 a year'
Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""These figures hammer home the impact uncertainty is having on the business environment.""Unsure of what's around the corner, businesses' investment in the new equipment and technology that drives up their performance has been stifled. Many companies are also trimming their investment pipelines for the year ahead to build up a cash cushion in anticipation of challenging economic conditions ahead.""
Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondentWhy does productivity, the amount of output you get from each worker, matter so muchIn the long term, rising living standards need rising productivity.There's a well-known line from the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman on this:  ""Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country's ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker"". The period of weak productivity growth after the financial crisis has been a time when the economy has, for most of the time, been growing but not strongly.The one rather brighter spot has been the other element in the productivity calculation, employment.Britain now has the highest percentage of the population in employment since at least 1971 (that's how far back this particular data series goes).More jobs, but less productive than they would have been, had productivity grown at the rates we have seen in previous decades.
Jon Boys, from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: ""Businesses may have more immediate concerns than raising productivity, but it's the only way to increase pay packets in the long term. ""We mustn't be fooled by recent strong earnings growth figures, which have been driven by a tight labour market and not an increase in employers' ability to pay.""Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, commented: ""Heightened concerns over Brexit - especially serious concerns among many companies of the UK leaving the EU without a deal - has clearly caused companies to limit their investment with damaging implications for productivity. ""If a Brexit deal is agreed and enacted by 31 October, this will hopefully dilute business uncertainty and provide some boost to business investment, which would be good news for productivity prospects."""

Brexit will have 'spillover' effects on other economies, says IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva
The new head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that Brexit in whatever form will be ""painful"", adding to the effects of a global slowdown.Kristalina Georgieva said the split will hurt not only the UK and European Union, but also low income countries with economic ties to them.IMF data show that growth has already slowed in almost 90% of the world.""It is very obvious that this [Brexit] is going to be painful,"" she told the BBC.""It is very important that we all concentrate also on spillover impacts for the rest of the world, and I particularly worry about low-income countries that are in a significant way dependent on the European Union and the UK,"" she said.
Ms Georgieva spoke to the BBC ahead of the IMF's annual meeting in Washington next week, where members of the international lending body will discuss risks such as climate change, rising corporate debt and the cost of trade fights.""Unfortunately this is not great news,"" she said of Brexit. ""And it comes at a time of compounded other factors that slow down growth.""Trade warThe US and China are locked in a trade war over state subsidies and technology theft that has led the two sides to impose tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods.US President Donald Trump has also picked fights with allies such as Europe and Canada over cars, steel and aluminium.The disputes have brought trade growth to a ""near standstill"" and hurt manufacturing and business investment, Ms Georgieva said.In 2020, the IMF predicts that they will knock almost 1% off of global growth in 2020 - or roughly $700bn.

A No 10 source has said a Brexit deal is ""essentially impossible"" after a call between the PM and Angela Merkel.Boris Johnson and the German chancellor spoke earlier about the proposals he put forward to the EU - but the source said she made clear a deal based on them was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"".The BBC's Adam Fleming said there was ""scepticism"" within the EU that Mrs Merkel would have used such language.And the EU's top official warned the UK against a ""stupid blame game"". President of the European Council Donald Tusk sent a public tweet to Mr Johnson, telling him ""the future of Europe and the UK"" was at stake.

With efforts to get a deal by the end of the month on an apparent knife edge, Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar have said they hope to meet later in the week.Amid frantic diplomatic manoeuvring in European capitals, details of a call earlier on Tuesday between the UK and German leaders have reignited tensions across the continent. The No 10 source suggested Mrs Merkel told her counterpart the only way to break the deadlock was for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and for it to permanently accept EU single market rules on trade in goods.

This, the source said, marked a shift in Germany's approach and made a negotiated deal ""essentially impossible"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the conversation had been ""frank"" but denied the negotiations were all but over.Mrs Merkel's spokesman said her office would not reveal details of ""private, closed"" conversations but Norbert Rottgen, an ally of the chancellor who is chair of the Bundestag's Foreign Affairs Committee, said there was ""no new German position"".He tweeted that a deal based on the UK's latest proposals had ""been unrealistic from the beginning and yet the EU has been willing to engage"". The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said it was ""no secret"" Berlin found the UK's proposed new customs solution for Northern Ireland problematic.

Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is continuing to meet EU counterparts in Brussels, but the No 10 source said Tuesday morning's phone call had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down."" They said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland, or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s - by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals.
Hands up if all this stuff about ""spokesman"" and ""sources"" is driving you bonkers? Here's the in-brief explanation of how it works at Westminster.The prime minister has an official spokesman. They work for the government, not the political party that is in government. They give two briefings a day to reporters when Parliament is sitting and they are on the record. That is to say we report what is said and we report who said it - although by convention we don't actually name the spokesman.There are two reasons for this: they are speaking on behalf of the PM, not themselves. And sometimes a deputy does the briefing instead. In addition to the official spokesman, there are other people in Downing Street who will talk to journalists. For some, that is their specific job. For others, it is not.These people will always talk to us off the record - so we can quote them, but not name them, or do anything that risks identifying them.Journalists always prefer on the record quotes, but in politics as in life, people are often more candid in private, and so we can get a greater sense of what is going on in return for respecting the terms on which the information has been given to us.
Updating MPs on contingency planning for a no-deal exit, minister Michael Gove said there was still ""every chance"" of a deal but the EU must engage with the UK's plans.""In setting out these proposals, we've moved - it is now time for the EU to move too,"" he said.Ireland's Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister), Simon Coveney, said a deal was still possible but ""not any at cost"" - and the UK must accept it had ""responsibilities"" on the island of Ireland.

The UK and Irish leaders spoke on the phone for 40 minutes on Tuesday, after which No 10 said both sides ""strongly reiterated"" their desire to reach a deal.But Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told MPs the government was ""intent on collapsing the talks and engaging in a reckless blame game"".""The stark reality is the government put forward proposals that were designed to fail,"" he said, adding that it was ""beneath contempt"" that, according to a Downing Street source reported by the Spectator, the UK could withdraw security co-operation from other EU countries if it were forced to remain beyond 31 October.
How could no-deal happen?
Brexit deal possible but not at any cost - Coveney
Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit court move
What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
The PM has insisted the UK will leave the EU on that date, with or without a deal.  That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit.
No-one really wants to comment directly on this phone call - certainly not Berlin - but talking to EU officials and diplomats in Brussels, there is considerable scepticism.That's because the words attributed to Angela Merkel do not reflect the EU's agreed language. For one, Mrs Merkel and the EU have repeatedly said they will keep talking to the last second and will not pull the plug before that. And secondly, the No 10 source claims the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland permanently ""trapped"" in the customs union - Brussels insists it doesn't want that at all, it just wants the option for Northern Ireland stay inside temporarily until something else is worked out.So as I say, scepticism. It could be a misinterpretation or it could be a deliberate bit of spin, because we're now entering into a blame game about whose fault it is that progress isn't being made.
The key focus of the new UK plans is to replace the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point.  After presenting them, government sources hoped the sides might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of talks almost immediately, but a number of senior EU figures, including Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, warned they did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done.Mr Varadkar has warned the Johnson plan could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole.

Dan Evans' evidence resulted in the conviction of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson
A former News of the World journalist convicted for phone-hacking said others may have been allowed to ""escape scrutiny"". Dan Evans received a 10-month suspended sentence for phone-hacking, making illegal payments to officials and perverting the course of justice.He said some evidence to the Leveson public inquiry may have been misleading and said police were not investigating. The UK government said the inquiry and three police probes were comprehensive.Mr Evans' comments come days after it emerged the Duke of Sussex is suing Mirror Group Newspapers and News Group Newspapers for alleged phone-hacking.
The revelation in 2011 that Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator used by the News of the World, hacked the phone of murdered teenager Milly Dowler caused national outrage.It led to a public inquiry into the behaviour of the press, the police and politicians, chaired by Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson.The inquiry was split into two parts, with the second part deferred until after criminal prosecutions concluded in 2016.But the government closed down the second part, meaning many of the claims of the victims were never heard in an open forum. It also meant the Leveson Inquiry did not hear from many of the individuals, like Mr Evans, who were most directly involved in phone-hacking.Mr Evans, originally from Denbighshire, said: ""There are questions to answer over the evidence that was previously offered at Leveson, the stuff that would have been covered by Leveson Two but just hasn't been.""

He also described the evidence given to the same inquiry by the former editor of the Sunday Mirror, Tina Weaver, as ""wrong"".  Although he acknowledged neither had given evidence before the court, he found: ""The practice of phone-hacking was indeed widespread, institutionalised and long standing.""Editorial staff not only knew about the practice, but are also likely to have conducted it themselves.""

The CPS also decided not to put Mr Evans forward as a prosecution witness, despite using him successfully in a previous trial.'No effect'BBC Wales approached Tina Weaver and tried to make contact with Richard Wallace for a statement, but did not receive a response. Neither of them were ever accused of any offence in relation to phone-hacking.Mirror Group Newspapers, owned by Reach plc, declined to comment. Mr Evans said he and others have referred Mr Justice Mann's conclusions to the Metropolitan Police, but they ""haven't had any effect"". Wrexham MP Ian Lucas, a member of the Westminster culture committee, said he expected the police to investigate.""I can't understand why there wouldn't be a proper investigation,"" he said.""It's vital that people who give evidence are straightforward and give a full account of themselves.""If people did not do that then it undermines the strength of the inquiry, it undermines the process and we cannot really accept fully the content of the conclusions of Lord Justice Leveson.""

They would ""neither confirm nor deny"" whether an investigation had begun. Mr Evans believes the second part of the Leveson Inquiry should go ahead and in the mean time has started a research project called Alt Lev. He denies it is just an attempt to point the finger at others.

People who live by the coast are among the lowest paid in the country
Workers living in seaside areas are likely to earn on average £1,600 less per year than those living inland, analysis has found.The research also found two-thirds of coastal areas had seen a real terms fall in wages since 2010.The All Parliamentary Group for Coastal Communities said the findings showed seaside towns were ""being left behind"". But the government said its £200m Coastal Communities Fund was changing lives.This week BBC News is profiling what life is like in seaside communities across the country as part of the Coastal Britain project.
The most deprived places in England are found by the sea, according to government figures.
Struggling to pay rent

Young workers such as Danny (second left), Tamia (second right) and Jack (far right) say low wages in Penzance are a real problem
In Penzance in Cornwall young workers said they were struggling to find well paid, long-term employment by the coast.""I love Penzance but I'm also sick of it,"" said 18-year-old Danny Hammond, who works as a waiter in a local restaurant.""I earn £6.30 an hour, which isn't great and people older than me really struggle to pay the rent or the mortgage.""
Image caption
Tamia Mallam said she could not see many long term career prospects in Penzance
Tamia Mallam, 20, said many people she knew struggled in seasonal jobs connected with the tourism industry.""When I worked In St Ives, between May and September there was lots of work because of the summer season, but then you'll be told suddenly that you're going to be unemployed. That is really tough,"" she said.""There aren't many prospects for a career around here, it's a choice of working either in a boring retail job or as waitress.""Trainee carpenter Jack Slater was more optimistic about his future job prospects.""Lots of my friends have moved away from Penzance to look for better paid jobs and that's why I want to get myself a trade,"" the 18-year-old said.""I want to stay in Cornwall because it's beautiful and this is my home, and they're always building new homes round here which should mean I'll always have work.""
The issue of low pay affects coastal communities across the whole country.BBC News has analysed income data collected by the Office for National Statistics for 632 parliamentary constituencies in Great Britain. Taking into account full and part time workers the analysis found:
In coastal constituencies, the typical (median) worker in 2018 earned £22,104 before tax
That was £1,681 less than the typical worker in a non-coastal area, who earned £23,785 before tax
When inflation was taken into account annual wages fell in two-thirds of constituencies between 2010 and 2018, a ""real terms"" decrease
The coastal constituencies of Wirral West and Weston-Super-Mare have seen real terms wages fall by around 25% since 2010
Coastal areas where wages have fallen the mostParliamentary constituencies, gross annual income (£)Figures for 2010 adjusted for inflation, shown in 2018 pricesSource: Office for National Statistics/BBC analysisLow wages tended to be prevalent in coastal areas because a higher proportion of people worked in low skilled, low paid seasonal jobs.A major report published by the House of Lords earlier this year said seaside towns had for too long been reliant on tourism to drive their local economies.
Seaside areas named England's most deprived
The seaside towns where the young might disappear
Seaside towns 'desperate for reinvention'
Mike Hill MP, chair of the all Parliamentary Group for Coastal Communities, said ""for a long time coastal communities have felt forgotten"". ""Many of these areas have lost industries like shipbuilding that once provided thousands of well paid jobs,"" he said. ""There's research that shows that without major changes, by 2030 places like my own constituency of Hartlepool could see lots of young people leave coastal areas, which underlines why we need the right investment to protect the long term future of our coastal towns."" At its party conference in September, Labour promised to build 37 offshore wind farms, which it claimed would generate more than 60,000 new well paid jobs in coastal areas.

The government said since 2012 its dedicated Coastal Communities Fund had invested more than £200m in seaside areas, while more than a quarter of the 100 towns initially selected to share its £3.6bn Stronger Towns Fund were on the coast.Jake Berry MP, Minister for the Northern Powerhouse and Local Growth, said these initiatives had begun to transform people's lives.""For years government has only talked about creating growth in our cities. But we are investing in coastal areas and we've given councils across the country a real terms increase in their budgets for next year,"" he added.

The two leaders are due to meet again in the coming days
It will be ""very difficult"" for the UK and the EU to reach a Brexit agreement before the 31 October deadline, Irish leader Leo Varadkar has said.He told Irish broadcaster RTE ""big gaps"" remained between the two sides.Amid claims on Tuesday that talks were close to collapse, he also suggested the language around the discussions had turned toxic ""in some quarters"".Mr Varadkar and Boris Johnson are expected to meet for further Brexit talks later this week. The UK has said the EU needs to ""move quickly"" to stop it leaving without an agreement at the end of the month.
The end for negotiations in Brussels?
Brexit deal essentially impossible - No 10 source
How could a no-deal Brexit happen?
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who spoke with Mr Johnson by phone for about 45 minutes on Tuesday, said he would strive until the ""last moment"" to reach a deal with the UK, but ""not at any cost"" to his country, Northern Ireland and the rest of Europe. He also downplayed the chances of any agreement being struck before the crucial summit of EU leaders on 17 October, during which next steps for Brexit are likely to be decided.

""I think it's going to be very difficult to secure an agreement by next week, quite frankly,"" Mr Varadkar said.""Essentially, what the UK has done is repudiated the deal that we negotiated in good faith with prime minister [Theresa] May's government over two years and have sort of put half of that now back on the table, and are saying that's a concession. And of course it isn't really.""Mr Varadkar added that it was his job to hold the UK to commitments it had made since the 2016 referendum to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland and uphold the Good Friday Agreement.

Brexitcast: Blame game
The Irish leader's comments came after a No 10 source claimed on Tuesday that Germany was now making it ""essentially impossible"" for the UK to leave the EU with a deal.That assessment followed a ""frank"" phone call between Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, during which they discussed Brexit proposals the UK prime minister put forward last week to the EU.After the call, a No 10 source said Mrs Merkel had made clear a deal based on the prime minister's plans was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"" - though the BBC's Adam Fleming said there was ""scepticism"" within the EU that she would have used such language. The No 10 source also suggested Mrs Merkel told her counterpart the only way to break the deadlock was for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and for it to permanently accept EU single market rules on trade in goods.This, the source said, marked a shift in Germany's approach and made a negotiated deal ""essentially impossible"".

In response, the EU's top official, European Council President Donald Tusk, accused Mr Johnson of engaging in a ""stupid blame game"".In a tweet to the prime minister, he added: ""At stake is the future of Europe and the UK, as well as the security and interests of our people. ""You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis (where are you going)?""European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said that if negotiations fail, ""the explanation will be found in the British camp (because) the original sin is found on the islands and not on the continent"".Speaking to the French Les Echos newspaper, he added: ""A no-deal Brexit would lead to a collapse of the United Kingdom and a weakening of growth on the continent."" In his interview with RTE, Mr Varadkar was asked whether he was concerned the language around the talks was ""getting toxic"".""I think it is, from some quarters, but you know I don't play dirty. You know, I don't think most EU leaders do either. We've been very straight up from when the referendum happened.""'Real catastrophe'The prime minister also hosted European Parliament president David Sassoli in Downing Street on Tuesday, but the MEP left saying ""no progress"" had been made.Mr Sassoli later told the BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Angela Merkel's opinions must be taken seriously. We are all very worried because there are only a few days left.""Because we understand that going out without an agreement leads to having a real problem, if not a real catastrophe.""

Following the meeting, Downing Street said there was ""little time"" left to negotiate a new legally-binding withdrawal agreement, but Mr Johnson remained committed to doing all he could.""We need to move quickly and work together to agree a deal,"" a No 10 spokesman said.""He [the prime minister] reiterated that if we did not reach an agreement then the UK will leave without a deal on 31 October.""The PM's pledge comes despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. While negotiations are continuing in Brussels, Mr Sassoli said a deal likely to command the support of MEPs was a ""long way off"". Meanwhile, 19 Labour MPs have written to the European Commission president Mr Junker calling for a Brexit deal to be made with the government without any further delay. Caroline Flint, who represents the leave-supporting constituency of Don Valley, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""uncertainty of Brexit has gone on too long"" and the group did not think it was ""impossible"" to resolve the Irish border issue.

'Prospect of a deal looks remote'
The prospect of securing an agreement that would allow the UK to leave the European Union with a deal three weeks today - on 31 October - looks remote, and few believe there is much prospect of a major breakthrough on Thursday. Each side's plan is rejected by the other, and the EU Summit - where any deal would have to be signed off - is just a week away. With time in such short supply, the focus is turning to what happens next, how the government might seek to frustrate Parliament's desire to stop an imminent no-deal Brexit, and how soon - whatever happens - a general election might follow. For more analysis, read BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's blog.
Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to use a speech in Northampton later to reiterate his position that Labour will agree to a general election as soon as no-deal has been taken ""off the table"", as the PM ""can't be trusted not to break the law"".He is also expected to accuse Mr Johnson of ""using the Queen"" to deliver a pre-election Tory party political broadcast at next week's State Opening of Parliament.He will say: ""This government isn't going to put any legislation before Parliament... holding a Queen's Speech before an election is a cynical stunt.""

The film, Lost Lives, is a requiem for those killed in the Troubles
In 1991, four men sat down in Belfast to write a book of the dead.They resolved to put on record the stories of what happened to every man, woman and child killed during Northern Ireland's Troubles.Their testament to suffering would take eight years of painstaking research. They detailed 3,700 lives shattered. Their book was Lost Lives.Now, two film makers and a host of Irish actors have followed in those writers' footsteps.

Taking Lost Lives as their inspiration, they have created a requiem for the Troubles dead.
Liam Neeson, Ciarán Hinds, Kenneth Branagh, Adrian Dunbar and Bronagh Waugh are among a long list of acting talent from Northern Ireland who have given their voices to the film. The book was written by veteran NI journalist David McKittrick, BBC journalists Chris Thornton and the late Seamus Kelters, and political commentator Brian Feeney. At a later stage, David McVea joined in.

First published in 1999, it was an act of remembrance, lest a single life be forgotten.It is considered the go-to reference book and an authority on the Troubles.In the Irish Times in 2006, journalist Susan McKay wrote: ""A Tyrone man bought five copies. Five members of his family, all in the security forces, had been killed.""A Donegal man found out from the book that it was the UVF, and not the IRA, that had killed his brother - as his family had supposed for 30 years. ""It has been read out in churches, Protestant and Catholic. A woman wept so much over the book in a shop she left mascara stains on the page at which she'd opened it.""'War is Hell'The new film, which has its premiere in London later on Thursday, tells individual stories from the book, using archive footage, music and the book's words spoken by actors to bring them to life.

Actress Bronagh Waugh narrating her part in Lost Lives
I felt deeply honoured to take part. I was born in Coleraine in 1982 and I knew friends whose parents had been killed in the Troubles.I didn't know that the book, Lost Lives, existed. When I held it in my hands, what struck me was the sheer volume of it. I wanted to read all of it. How personal the stories were. People can become statistics. But here were the stories of real people. There were so many ordinary lives and what would those lives have been, if they had not been killed?At the recording, I was reading the story of a mother and my voice kept breaking. It was so visceral and real.What Lost Lives shows is how fragile peace is and how we must never take it for granted.I want to wrap my country up in cotton wool.
Lost Lives - a production commissioned by BBC Northern Ireland with funding from NI Screen - is a film about humanity and inhumanity, about innocence and experience during the Troubles - a local story that played out for more than 30 years on a worldwide stage.It marries the beauty of the natural world with old footage from past atrocities.The camera holds the face of a toddler in a knitted bonnet sitting in her pram at a street corner, watching her world collapse.A woman stares out from behind lace curtains as violence unfolds on her street.A man is filmed abandoning his home, loading his worldly possessions on to a trailer with an air of resignation, lumping a huge statue of the Virgin Mary on the top.The film is an elegy that flicks from children playing with toy guns to the crackle of real gunfire.The viewer is brought back again and again to the fluttering pages of the Lost Lives book and to story after story of heartbreak.We hear about the parents who left Belfast after their child was shot dead... but they had to come back.""I wasn't content knowing that Patrick was buried here, I wanted to be near him,"" said Patrick Rooney's mother.

The authors of the book wanted to communicate the human cost of the Troubles
We hear the words of Mary Isobel Thompson's widower: ""She was a happy wee woman, the world's best.""There was just the two of us, we had no family, so we always went everywhere together. Now I am by myself. Sometimes I do not realise, I think I hear her calling for me...""And there is Philip Rafferty, just 14, abducted, hooded and shot dead. He had been on his way to a music lesson.His Jewish uncle wrote a letter to a newspaper. He said he had lost a cousin to Hitler's gas chambers and now, more than 30 years later, another child had died needlessly. He said Philip was a small frail boy who suffered from asthma. He was his parents pride and joy. He was barely 14. ""That's all the years Philip Rafferty had... Why did he die?""

Michael Hewitt and Dermot Lavery ensured that every name in the book Lost Lives appears in the film
We started making the film three years ago, but we were having conversations about it long before that.Lost Lives is a reference book, but it represents much more than that. The challenge was how do you make a film from a book like that?We made a commitment that every name in the book should be listed in the film.Then we found extracts where there was a quote from a family member that reflected the hurt felt by those left behind. We were very much drawn to that.The actors all came on board so readily. There was something of real value in the fact that they were lending their support and their voices to the film. We felt enormously honoured. Nobody needed persuading or to be asked a second time.We are very clear that we are living in troubled times. We need to remember the cost when things are settled through violence.When you hold that book in your hand, you can feel the weight of all that was lost, all the lives. You have to ask why.
Lost Lives, the film, is being released to mark 50 years since the Troubles began.It receives its world premiere at the BFI London Film Festival on Thursday 10 October, followed by a question-and-answer session with the film makers and narrators which will feature at UK screenings on 23 October.Actors Stephen Rea, Brid Brennan, Roma Downey, Michelle Fairley, Brendan Gleeson, Dan Gordon, James Nesbitt, Conleth Hill, Susan Lynch,  Emer O'Connor, Stephen Rea, Judith Roddy, Michael Smiley, Bronagh Waugh Des McAleer, Martin McCann, Ian McElhinney and Sean McGinley also lend their voices.The film is also being shown at Belfast's QFT cinema from Friday 11 October. It will be shown on BBC television later this year."

The film, Lost Lives, is a requiem for those killed in the Troubles
In 1991, four men sat down in Belfast to write a book of the dead.They resolved to put on record the stories of what happened to every man, woman and child killed during Northern Ireland's Troubles.Their testament to suffering would take eight years of painstaking research. They detailed 3,700 lives shattered. Their book was Lost Lives.Now, two film makers and a host of Irish actors have followed in those writers' footsteps.

Taking Lost Lives as their inspiration, they have created a requiem for the Troubles dead.
Liam Neeson, Ciarán Hinds, Kenneth Branagh, Adrian Dunbar and Bronagh Waugh are among a long list of acting talent from Northern Ireland who have given their voices to the film. The book was written by veteran NI journalist David McKittrick, BBC journalists Chris Thornton and the late Seamus Kelters, and political commentator Brian Feeney. At a later stage, David McVea joined in.

Lost Lives authors Seamus Kelters and David McKittrick pictured at the book launch in 1999
First published in 1999, it was an act of remembrance, lest a single life be forgotten.It is considered the go-to reference book and an authority on the Troubles.In the Irish Times in 2006, journalist Susan McKay wrote: ""A Tyrone man bought five copies. Five members of his family, all in the security forces, had been killed.""A Donegal man found out from the book that it was the UVF, and not the IRA, that had killed his brother - as his family had supposed for 30 years. ""It has been read out in churches, Protestant and Catholic. A woman wept so much over the book in a shop she left mascara stains on the page at which she'd opened it.""'War is Hell'The new film, which has its premiere in London later on Thursday, tells individual stories from the book, using archive footage, music and the book's words spoken by actors to bring them to life.

Actress Bronagh Waugh narrating her part in Lost Lives
I felt deeply honoured to take part. I was born in Coleraine in 1982 and I knew friends whose parents had been killed in the Troubles.I didn't know that the book, Lost Lives, existed. When I held it in my hands, what struck me was the sheer volume of it. I wanted to read all of it. How personal the stories were. People can become statistics. But here were the stories of real people. There were so many ordinary lives and what would those lives have been, if they had not been killed?At the recording, I was reading the story of a mother and my voice kept breaking. It was so visceral and real.What Lost Lives shows is how fragile peace is and how we must never take it for granted.I want to wrap my country up in cotton wool.
Lost Lives - a production commissioned by BBC Northern Ireland with funding from NI Screen - is a film about humanity and inhumanity, about innocence and experience during the Troubles - a local story that played out for more than 30 years on a worldwide stage.It marries the beauty of the natural world with old footage from past atrocities.The camera holds the face of a toddler in a knitted bonnet sitting in her pram at a street corner, watching her world collapse.A woman stares out from behind lace curtains as violence unfolds on her street.A man is filmed abandoning his home, loading his worldly possessions on to a trailer with an air of resignation, lumping a huge statue of the Virgin Mary on the top.The film is an elegy that flicks from children playing with toy guns to the crackle of real gunfire.The viewer is brought back again and again to the fluttering pages of the Lost Lives book and to story after story of heartbreak.We hear about the parents who left Belfast after their child was shot dead... but they had to come back.""I wasn't content knowing that Patrick was buried here, I wanted to be near him,"" said Patrick Rooney's mother.

We hear the words of Mary Isobel Thompson's widower: ""She was a happy wee woman, the world's best.""There was just the two of us, we had no family, so we always went everywhere together. Now I am by myself. Sometimes I do not realise, I think I hear her calling for me...""And there is Philip Rafferty, just 14, abducted, hooded and shot dead. He had been on his way to a music lesson.His Jewish uncle wrote a letter to a newspaper. He said he had lost a cousin to Hitler's gas chambers and now, more than 30 years later, another child had died needlessly. He said Philip was a small frail boy who suffered from asthma. He was his parents pride and joy. He was barely 14. ""That's all the years Philip Rafferty had... Why did he die?""

Michael Hewitt and Dermot Lavery ensured that every name in the book Lost Lives appears in the film
We started making the film three years ago, but we were having conversations about it long before that.Lost Lives is a reference book, but it represents much more than that. The challenge was how do you make a film from a book like that?We made a commitment that every name in the book should be listed in the film.Then we found extracts where there was a quote from a family member that reflected the hurt felt by those left behind. We were very much drawn to that.The actors all came on board so readily. There was something of real value in the fact that they were lending their support and their voices to the film. We felt enormously honoured. Nobody needed persuading or to be asked a second time.We are very clear that we are living in troubled times. We need to remember the cost when things are settled through violence.When you hold that book in your hand, you can feel the weight of all that was lost, all the lives. You have to ask why.
Lost Lives, the film, is being released to mark 50 years since the Troubles began.It receives its world premiere at the BFI London Film Festival on Thursday 10 October, followed by a question-and-answer session with the film makers and narrators which will feature at UK screenings on 23 October.Actors Stephen Rea, Brid Brennan, Roma Downey, Michelle Fairley, Brendan Gleeson, Dan Gordon, James Nesbitt, Conleth Hill, Susan Lynch,  Emer O'Connor, Stephen Rea, Judith Roddy, Michael Smiley, Bronagh Waugh Des McAleer, Martin McCann, Ian McElhinney and Sean McGinley also lend their voices.The film is also being shown at Belfast's QFT cinema from Friday 11 October. It will be shown on BBC television later this year."

Two of the so-called ""IS Beatles"" have been taken out of Syria to ""a secure location controlled by the US"", President Donald Trump has said. El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey are accused of being part of an Islamic State group cell which kidnapped and murdered Western hostages in Syria.The pair - who are from London - are in the custody of the American military, according to US media reports.In a tweet, Mr Trump described them as ""the worst of the worst"".He said the decision to remove them from Syria had been taken ""in case the Kurds or Turkey lose control"".

The news comes after the US withdrew its forces from the region this week.On Wednesday President Trump told reporters the US had transferred ""some of the most dangerous IS fighters"" amid fears they could escape custody as Turkish troops invade Kurdish-held territory in northern Syria.The New York Times and Washington Post say the pair have been removed from a prison run by Kurdish militia in northern Syria.

Other members of the IS cell - dubbed ""The Beatles"" because of their British accents - included Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, who was killed in a US air strike in 2015, and Aine Davis, who has been jailed in Turkey.Emwazi is thought to have killed US journalist James Foley in 2014.All four were radicalised in the UK before travelling to Syria. Elsheikh and Kotey are designated as terrorists by the US state department, which links them to the group's executions and ""exceptionally cruel torture methods"" including electric shocks, waterboarding and mock executions.They were said to have been captured by Kurdish forces in January 2018.

The New York Times reports that the US is planning to take Mr Elsheikh and Mr Kotey to Virginia, where they will be put on trial.It remains to be seen whether the evidence against the pair amassed by British investigators will be handed over in full to US authorities.Former Prime Minister Theresa May, when she was home secretary in 2015, told Washington the UK would only hand over evidence after receiving a categorical guarantee that neither man would be executed.The UK has long sought and obtained such a death penalty assurance from the US.That position was reiterated by Mrs May's successor, Amber Rudd, but then reversed after Sajid Javid entered the Home Office in April 2018.Mr Javid decided to hand over 600 witness statements, without seeking any kind of guarantee that Mr Elsheikh and Mr Kotey would not be put to death.Mr Elsheikh's mother, Maha Elgizouli challenged the decision but, in January, lost that case in the High Court.The issue is currently being decided by the UK Supreme Court."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar will meet for talks later to discuss the UK's Brexit proposals.Downing Street said the meeting was to allow ""detailed discussions"" on the process of securing a deal.Mr Johnson has said he remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about a deal.But on Wednesday EU leaders accused the UK of putting forward untested ideas, adding that progress towards a new deal had been limited. A similar sentiment was expressed on Tuesday by Mr Varadkar, who suggested it would be ""very difficult"" for the UK and the EU to reach a Brexit agreement before the 31 October deadline.

How are the UK's talks with the EU going?
The meeting between the two leaders will take place in the north-west of England, with Mr Johnson still insisting the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of the month.That is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October.On Wednesday, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said the PM was gearing up to bypass legal obstacles to a no-deal Brexit by sending one letter requesting an extension and, in the same instance, submitting a second memo telling European leaders he does not want one.Asked on ITV's Peston programme whether the idea of sending two letters to the EU was a possible loophole, Ms Leadsom replied: ""Absolutely.""

Mr Johnson put forward fresh proposals for a Brexit deal last week, but Mr Varadkar has said ""big gaps"" remain between the UK and the EU.Former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond accused Mr Johnson of tabling a proposed deal that ""is not going to fly, and was never going to fly"". ""Much of it is stuff which has already been tried with the EU in the past and rejected in the past,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

What are the PM's border plans? Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
Updating MEPs on the state of talks, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he believed ""with goodwill"" on both sides there could be an agreement in the run-up to the EU summit later this month.But he added: ""To put things very frankly and to try to be objective, we are not really in a position where we are able to find an agreement.""
EU heading for no-deal by mistake, Jeremy Hunt warns
What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
How could a no-deal Brexit happen?
As it stood, he continued, the UK was proposing replacing an ""operable, practical and legal solution"" to avoid a hard Irish border with ""one that is simply a temporary solution"".Mr Barnier said the UK's suggested alternative to the Irish backstop - which would see customs checks conducted away from the border at business premises or electronically - ""had not been tested"" and was ""largely based"" on exemptions for small businesses and technology that ""has yet to be developed"".
'Prospect of a deal looks remote'
The prospect of securing an agreement that would allow the UK to leave the European Union with a deal three weeks today - on 31 October - looks remote, and few believe there is much prospect of a major breakthrough on Thursday. Each side's plan is rejected by the other, and the EU Summit - where any deal would have to be signed off - is just a week away. With time in such short supply, the focus is turning to what happens next, how the government might seek to frustrate Parliament's desire to stop an imminent no-deal Brexit, and how soon - whatever happens - a general election might follow. For more analysis, read BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's blog.
Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to use a speech in Northampton later to reiterate his position that Labour will agree to a general election as soon as no-deal has been taken ""off the table"", as the PM ""can't be trusted not to break the law"".He is also expected to accuse Mr Johnson of ""using the Queen"" to deliver a pre-election Tory party political broadcast at next week's State Opening of Parliament.He will say: ""This government isn't going to put any legislation before Parliament... holding a Queen's Speech before an election is a cynical stunt.""

The film, Lost Lives, is a requiem for those killed in the Troubles
In 1991, four men sat down in Belfast to write a book of the dead.They resolved to put on record the stories of what happened to every man, woman and child killed during Northern Ireland's Troubles.Their testament to suffering would take eight years of painstaking research. They detailed 3,700 lives shattered. Their book was Lost Lives.Now, two film makers and a host of Irish actors have followed in those writers' footsteps.

Taking Lost Lives as their inspiration, they have created a requiem for the Troubles dead.
Liam Neeson, Ciarán Hinds, Kenneth Branagh, Adrian Dunbar and Bronagh Waugh are among a long list of acting talent from Northern Ireland who have given their voices to the film. The book was written by veteran NI journalist David McKittrick, BBC journalists Chris Thornton and the late Seamus Kelters, and political commentator Brian Feeney. At a later stage, David McVea joined in.

Lost Lives authors Seamus Kelters and David McKittrick pictured at the book launch in 1999
First published in 1999, it was an act of remembrance, lest a single life be forgotten.It is considered the go-to reference book and an authority on the Troubles.In the Irish Times in 2006, journalist Susan McKay wrote: ""A Tyrone man bought five copies. Five members of his family, all in the security forces, had been killed.""A Donegal man found out from the book that it was the UVF, and not the IRA, that had killed his brother - as his family had supposed for 30 years. ""It has been read out in churches, Protestant and Catholic. A woman wept so much over the book in a shop she left mascara stains on the page at which she'd opened it.""'War is Hell'The new film, which has its premiere in London later on Thursday, tells individual stories from the book, using archive footage, music and the book's words spoken by actors to bring them to life.

Actress Bronagh Waugh narrating her part in Lost Lives
I felt deeply honoured to take part. I was born in Coleraine in 1982 and I knew friends whose parents had been killed in the Troubles.I didn't know that the book, Lost Lives, existed. When I held it in my hands, what struck me was the sheer volume of it. I wanted to read all of it. How personal the stories were. People can become statistics. But here were the stories of real people. There were so many ordinary lives and what would those lives have been, if they had not been killed?At the recording, I was reading the story of a mother and my voice kept breaking. It was so visceral and real.What Lost Lives shows is how fragile peace is and how we must never take it for granted.I want to wrap my country up in cotton wool.
Lost Lives - a production commissioned by BBC Northern Ireland with funding from NI Screen - is a film about humanity and inhumanity, about innocence and experience during the Troubles - a local story that played out for more than 30 years on a worldwide stage.It marries the beauty of the natural world with old footage from past atrocities.The camera holds the face of a toddler in a knitted bonnet sitting in her pram at a street corner, watching her world collapse.A woman stares out from behind lace curtains as violence unfolds on her street.A man is filmed abandoning his home, loading his worldly possessions on to a trailer with an air of resignation, lumping a huge statue of the Virgin Mary on the top.The film is an elegy that flicks from children playing with toy guns to the crackle of real gunfire.The viewer is brought back again and again to the fluttering pages of the Lost Lives book and to story after story of heartbreak.We hear about the parents who left Belfast after their child was shot dead... but they had to come back.""I wasn't content knowing that Patrick was buried here, I wanted to be near him,"" said Patrick Rooney's mother.

We hear the words of Mary Isobel Thompson's widower: ""She was a happy wee woman, the world's best.""There was just the two of us, we had no family, so we always went everywhere together. Now I am by myself. Sometimes I do not realise, I think I hear her calling for me...""And there is Philip Rafferty, just 14, abducted, hooded and shot dead. He had been on his way to a music lesson.His Jewish uncle wrote a letter to a newspaper. He said he had lost a cousin to Hitler's gas chambers and now, more than 30 years later, another child had died needlessly. He said Philip was a small frail boy who suffered from asthma. He was his parents pride and joy. He was barely 14. ""That's all the years Philip Rafferty had... Why did he die?""

Which European countries have the most UK pension claimants?Source: DWP figures for August 2018If you are entitled to a UK state pension, you can claim it wherever you live in the world.If you live in the UK, your state pension is uprated every year in line with the triple lock, which means it rises by whichever is highest of average earnings, inflation or 2.5%.That is also the case if you live in the 27 other EU countries as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.Uprating will probably continue if the UK agrees a withdrawal agreement with the EU, depending on the terms agreed.The government has said that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will continue to uprate state pension payments to people living in those countries for the next three years.
That means the amount paid would increase by at least 2.5% in April 2020, April 2021 and April 2022.In later years, it will only uprate pensions if it has a reciprocal arrangement either with the whole of the EU or with each of the individual countries so that their state pensioners living in the UK also receive annual upratings.The Department for Work and Pensions told Reality Check: ""Insisting on reciprocal arrangements has been government policy for over 70 years and will continue to be so.""

This is not a problem for people claiming the UK state pension in the Republic of Ireland, Gibraltar and Switzerland, who will benefit from uprating whether or not there is a deal. In Switzerland, that is a result of the deal already done with the Swiss.
What trade deals has the UK done so far?
What will happen to mobile roaming charges after Brexit?
The UK already has reciprocal arrangements with a number of countries outside the EU, including the USA, Turkey, Jamaica and Israel, which mean that UK state pensions get uprated for people living there.It is that sort of deal that would have to be done with European countries.There are also places where lots of people claim UK state pensions but do not benefit from uprating such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.

Another complication from Brexit is that at the moment someone could work for 10 years in the UK, 10 years in France and 10 years in Italy, and when they came to retire they could apply for their state pension in the last country where they lived or worked, and the single claim would then be co-ordinated by that country's authorities.The withdrawal agreement is supposed to keep that co-ordination going, but if the UK leaves the EU with no deal then it will not be possible without further negotiations.Similarly, in order to claim the UK state pension at the moment, you have to have made National Insurance contributions for a minimum of 10 years.But, if you have worked in the UK for seven years, for example, and another European country for at least three years, then you can still claim a UK state pension - your work in another European country gets you over the line.You would only be paid based on your seven years of eligibility, but you would be able to claim it, which you would not otherwise have been able to do.Again, under the withdrawal agreement this would continue to be the case, but if the UK leaves with no deal then further negotiations would be needed.

The UK's economy is expected to avoid a recession despite new figures showing a surprise contraction in August.The economy shrank by 0.1% during the month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, but growth in July was revised upwards to 0.4%.In the three months to the end of August the economy grew 0.3%, indicating a recession can be avoided.The ONS said weakness in the manufacturing sector was offset by buoyant TV and film production.""Services provided [the] majority of the growth over the three months, with production and manufacturing falling back,"" said Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS.
The growth figures are being watched closely for signs of recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction - after the economy shrank in the second quarter for the first time since 2012.The next quarter runs until the end of October so the August data is the second month in the third quarter.The contraction during August, is not, however, expected to indicate a recession is looming.

There are only three families left on Llanelli's Brynmefys estate - most homes are boarded up
Powers to turn empty houses back into homes are not being used enough because of the cost and risk faced by councils, a report has said.Councils can take control of homes if they are left empty for two years and are in a bad condition.An inquiry heard taking action could be a ""massive risk"" because the process is expensive and might not work.The Welsh Government said it was on target to bring 5,000 empty homes back into use.It will consider the report carefully and respond in due course, a spokesman said, adding the government was improving its Houses to Homes scheme to simplify the grants and loan process and set up a team to help councils tackle empty homes.
AMs want a national plan to deal with the almost 30,000 empty homes in Wales.The assembly's equalities committee launched an inquiry because of concern that empty homes are blighting neighbourhoods.The report is about empty privately-owned homes - figures show there were 27,000 in April 2018 - but councils and social housing landlords also have 1,700 long-term empty properties.

Interest-free loans and grants are available to help owners renovate properties
There have been complaints about them attracting vandals and vermin and dragging down the price of nearby homes.Some homes deteriorated because owners inherited them and could not afford to renovate them, the committee heard, while some councils encountered uncooperative owners or could not trace them.
Empty properties brought back into use - 2018/19% by council of private houses empty for six months or more and brought back into use* Flintshire was 33% in 2017/18Source: InfoBase Cymru, July 2019Figures also show 4.6% of empty homes in the last year were brought back into use, although there was a variation between different councils, compared to 5.2% in 2017-18.The committee said it was ""particularly frustrating"" homes were going to waste when there is a shortage of housing.A dedicated empty homes officer ""can make a significant difference"", the report said, but not all councils have them.

Councils have powers to bring homes back into use by applying for empty dwelling management orders, but only four councils said they used them and only three used compulsory purchase orders.AMs were told there was a ""significant financial risk to authorities where substantial work is required to an empty property with no guarantee of a positive outcome"".

""Unfortunately it's a long process, it cannot happen overnight,"" she said. ""We have cases where it has taken about three years to go through the whole process and I understand that can be very, very frustrating for people who live within that community where they have a derelict property in the area.""The report recommends looking at new powers to force owners to sell.Committee chairman John Griffiths said: ""Local authorities have powers to deal with empty properties, but taking enforcement action isn't straightforward. It is time consuming and there is no certainty of it being successful.""The Welsh Local Government Association said the powers available to councils were ""complex and costly"" and needed to be reviewed.A spokesman said: ""Whilst we welcome in principle the recommendation of having a dedicated empty property officer in each authority, it is imperative that all authorities have the necessary discretion to make decisions around using their resources in response to the distinct circumstances in each area."""

The growth figures are being watched closely for signs of recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction - after the economy shrank in the second quarter for the first time since 2012.The next quarter runs until the end of October so the August data is the second month in the third quarter.The contraction during August, is not, however, expected to indicate a recession is looming. Reuters reported that the ONS said the economy would have to contract by an unusually large 1.5% in September for this happen."

There are only three families left on Llanelli's Brynmefys estate - most homes are boarded up
Powers to turn empty houses back into homes are not being used enough because of the cost and risk faced by councils, a report has said.Councils can take control of homes if they are left empty for two years and are in a bad condition.An inquiry heard taking action could be a ""massive risk"" because the process is expensive and might not work.The Welsh Government said it was on target to bring 5,000 empty homes back into use.It will consider the report carefully and respond in due course, a spokesman said, adding the government was improving its Houses to Homes scheme to simplify the grants and loan process and set up a team to help councils tackle empty homes.
AMs want a national plan to deal with the almost 30,000 empty homes in Wales.The assembly's equalities committee launched an inquiry because of concern that empty homes are blighting neighbourhoods.The report is about empty privately-owned homes - figures show there were 27,000 in April 2018 - but councils and social housing landlords also have 1,700 long-term empty properties.

Interest-free loans and grants are available to help owners renovate properties
There have been complaints about them attracting vandals and vermin and dragging down the price of nearby homes.Some homes deteriorated because owners inherited them and could not afford to renovate them, the committee heard, while some councils encountered uncooperative owners or could not trace them.
Empty properties brought back into use - 2018/19% by council of private houses empty for six months or more and brought back into use* Flintshire was 33% in 2017/18Source: InfoBase Cymru, July 2019Figures also show 4.6% of empty homes in the last year were brought back into use, although there was a variation between different councils, compared to 5.2% in 2017-18.The committee said it was ""particularly frustrating"" homes were going to waste when there is a shortage of housing.A dedicated empty homes officer ""can make a significant difference"", the report said, but not all councils have them.
Wales looks at thousands of new council homes by 2040
'Slums of the future' warning
'Blight' of 23,000 properties in Wales
Councils have powers to bring homes back into use by applying for empty dwelling management orders, but only four councils said they used them and only three used compulsory purchase orders.AMs were told there was a ""significant financial risk to authorities where substantial work is required to an empty property with no guarantee of a positive outcome"".

Llanelli's Brynmefys Estate is all-but abandoned
Buildings scarcely visibleThe council-owned Brynmefys estate, on the outskirts of Llanelli, is among the empty homes detailed in the report.All but three of the 32 homes have fallen into disrepair and serve as a ghostly reminder of the estate's heyday. Windows are boarded up, there are gaping holes in roofs. Some buildings are so overgrown they are scarcely visible from the road.

Scottish government plans to introduce Compulsory Sales Orders - forcing owners to sell - have been put on hold
The resident I spoke to, who did not want to be named, said there had been problems with fly-tipping and drugs in some of the empty houses.""When we first came here it was full of people, full of children,"" one of the remaining residents said.""It was a community. But it gradually changed over the years.""Three families still live on the estate - they've been there since the 1970s, but everyone else started moving out in the 1990s.

This house is empty in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan - the council brought five houses back into use in 2018-19
Carmarthenshire council, which has two full-time empty property officers, has 2,600 empty homes out of about 75,000 homes in the county.Linda Davies-Evans, the councillor in charge of housing, said empty homes were being transformed by ""working with empty property owners, getting in touch with owners, talking them through a process and helping financially if needed"".She taking enforcement action was a ""last resort"" that could cost up to £40,000. ""Unfortunately it's a long process, it cannot happen overnight,"" she said. ""We have cases where it has taken about three years to go through the whole process and I understand that can be very, very frustrating for people who live within that community where they have a derelict property in the area.""The report recommends looking at new powers to force owners to sell.Committee chairman John Griffiths said: ""Local authorities have powers to deal with empty properties, but taking enforcement action isn't straightforward. It is time consuming and there is no certainty of it being successful.""The Welsh Local Government Association said the powers available to councils were ""complex and costly"" and needed to be reviewed.A spokesman said: ""Whilst we welcome in principle the recommendation of having a dedicated empty property officer in each authority, it is imperative that all authorities have the necessary discretion to make decisions around using their resources in response to the distinct circumstances in each area."""

What is diplomatic immunity?About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship.It is granted by the 1961 Vienna Convention and means that, in theory, diplomats cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case.The convention also states that those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law.Where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity where they feel it is appropriate.Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.Drivers, cooks and other support staff whose names do not appear, but have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity as those who are listed.Equally, there are a number of foreign nationals in Britain attached to international organisations who have the same status and protection."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar will meet for talks later to discuss the UK's Brexit proposals.Downing Street said the meeting was to allow ""detailed discussions"" on the process of securing a deal.Mr Johnson has said he remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about a deal.But on Wednesday EU leaders accused the UK of putting forward untested ideas, adding that progress towards a new deal had been limited. A similar sentiment was expressed on Tuesday by Mr Varadkar, who suggested it would be ""very difficult"" for the UK and the EU to reach a Brexit agreement before the 31 October deadline.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ""behaviour and language"" used by the PM ""suggests he's not going to reach an agreement with the European Union"".But Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith called for MPs and commentators to ""step back"" and ""give this meeting space"".

EU leaders criticise UK Brexit proposals
How are the UK's talks with the EU going?
The meeting between the two leaders will take place in the north-west of England, with Mr Johnson still insisting the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of the month.That is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October.On Wednesday, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said the PM was gearing up to bypass legal obstacles to a no-deal Brexit by sending one letter requesting an extension and, in the same instance, submitting a second memo telling European leaders he does not want one.Asked on ITV's Peston programme whether the idea of sending two letters to the EU was a possible loophole, Ms Leadsom replied: ""Absolutely.""

Mr Johnson put forward fresh proposals for a Brexit deal last week, but Mr Varadkar has said ""big gaps"" remain between the UK and the EU.Former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond accused Mr Johnson of tabling a proposed deal that ""is not going to fly, and was never going to fly"". ""Much of it is stuff which has already been tried with the EU in the past and rejected in the past,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

What are the PM's border plans? Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
Updating MEPs on the state of talks, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he believed ""with goodwill"" on both sides there could be an agreement in the run-up to the EU summit later this month.But he added: ""To put things very frankly and to try to be objective, we are not really in a position where we are able to find an agreement.""
EU heading for no-deal by mistake, Jeremy Hunt warns
What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
How could a no-deal Brexit happen?

The prospect of securing an agreement that would allow the UK to leave the European Union with a deal three weeks today - on 31 October - looks remote, and few believe there is much prospect of a major breakthrough on Thursday. Each side's plan is rejected by the other, and the EU Summit - where any deal would have to be signed off - is just a week away. With time in such short supply, the focus is turning to what happens next, how the government might seek to frustrate Parliament's desire to stop an imminent no-deal Brexit, and how soon - whatever happens - a general election might follow. For more analysis, read BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's blog.
In a speech in Northampton, Mr Corbyn reiterated that his party would agree to a general election as soon as no-deal has been taken ""off the table"", as the PM ""can't be trusted not to break the law"".He also accused Mr Johnson of ""using the Queen"" to deliver a ""pre-election Tory party political broadcast"" at next week's state opening of Parliament.He told party supporters that the government had ""no obvious means"" of getting new laws passed, and holding a Queen's Speech before an election was a ""cynical stunt.""

It's down to the man, the myth and the mayhem that St George became so popular, said historian Dr Michael Carter
St George's Day is the patron saint's day of England, marked around the country on 23 April each year. But who was the dragon-slaying soldier named George who became the patron saint of England?Who was he?

George is also patron saint of many other countries including Portugal, Germany and Greece.
""He almost certainly was a real historical figure - probably a Christian Roman soldier named Georgios,"" said Dr Michael Carter, a historian at English Heritage. It is likely he was born in Cappadocia, Turkey around AD270 and was martyred at Nicomedia, or Lydda, modern day Israel, in the Roman province of Palestine in AD303, he said.What was he like?

St George was a glamorous saint who embodied good against evil, said Dr Carter
""He's a glamorous saint. He's said to be very handsome, there he is on his charger slaying a dragon,"" said Dr Carter.""His story is something which crosses cultures and periods. He represents honour, bravery and he had royal and military associations.
""There's so much in his legend that resonates with English values. He really is a patron of modern Britain in that he's quite diverse and international.""It's down to the man, myth and mayhem that he became so popular.""What about the dragon?

This lithograph from a drawing by Alexander Zick published in 1898 shows the legend of George and the dragon
This story was set in Silene in Libya, which was being terrorised by a ferocious sea-dragon, according to Candida Moss, Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame.""The inhabitants of the city had, under the king's command, given their children to be consumed by the dragon until finally the time came for the king's own daughter to be sacrificed,""  she told the BBC.""George, however, intervened, promising the king that if they were all baptised he would slay the dragon. The king did as he was told, George killed the dragon and everyone was saved.""The legend comes from ideas of embodiment of good and evil and combat between heroes and monsters, said Dr Carter.""It is basically an archetype. It's good conquers evil,"" he said.How did George die?

St George was tortured and beheaded during the Roman Emperor Diocletian's persecution of Christians
Roman Emperor Diocletian had ordered the persecution of Christians but St George refused to give up his faith and make a sacrifice to pagan gods, said Dr Carter.""Some stories say he was tortured for seven years in which every conceivable horror was inflicted upon him,"" said Dr Carter. ""He was crucified, racked, broken on the wheel, boiled alive and poisoned.""""Legend says he died on three occasions and was brought back to life by St Michael. He was ultimately beheaded.""Why did he become the patron saint of England?

What are the PM's border plans? Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""

Chris Davies (left) and Fiona Onasanya were ousted as MPs through recall petitions while Ian Paisley kept his seat
Protecting the secrecy of individuals who sign a petition to unseat a sitting MP should be improved, the Electoral Commission has said.It has reviewed the process, which was used for the first time last year to unsuccessfully recall the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Ian Paisley.The support of 10% of his North Antrim constituents was required to force a by-election but it fell short by 444 signatures.The commission has recommended changes.Recall petitions have been used twice this year.
In May, Fiona Onasanya was the first MP to be removed by the process, which she faced after she was jailed for lying about a speeding offence.She was expelled by Labour after her conviction and had been representing Peterborough as an independent.The Conservative MP Chris Davies lost his seat in June after he was convicted of a false expenses claim.'Secrecy important in democracy'The commission said that since the Recall of MPs Bill had begun to be used it felt there were areas in the process that had led to ""administrative challenges and issues with transparency and secrecy"".It called on the government to review the recall petition policy and make changes reflecting its recommendations.They include possibly reducing the length of time the petition remains open, suggesting a four-week period instead of the current six weeks.It also suggested reviewing the recall petition regulations in Northern Ireland to ensure ""appropriate access"" to inspect the register if there are concerns about fraud at future petitions.The commission recommended greater clarity about the closing time of signing places on the final day of the petition.Craig Westwood of the Electoral Commission said: ""When you vote at an election the way you have chosen to vote is protected by the secrecy of the ballot.""But the same is not true at a recall petition - when you enter a signing place it is clear that you are doing so to sign the petition to recall your MP.""He added: ""Secrecy is an important principle in our democracy and we have therefore asked the UK government to consider ways to mitigate this.""He suggested one measure could be to introduce an equivalent to the signing sheet for those who oppose the petition."

What is diplomatic immunity?About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship.It is granted by the 1961 Vienna Convention and means that, in theory, diplomats cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case.The convention also states that those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law.Where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity where they feel it is appropriate.Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.Drivers, cooks and other support staff whose names do not appear, but have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity as those who are listed.Equally, there are a number of foreign nationals in Britain attached to international organisations who have the same status and protection."

A Labour government would hold a Brexit referendum soon after winning a general election, Jeremy Corbyn has promised.The party leader also said it was his ""absolute priority"" to remove the chance of a no-deal exit from the EU happening on 31 October.Speaking in Northampton, he outlined plans to ban fracking, end universal credit and build more affordable homes.The government is promising that Brexit will happen on 31 October, with or without a new deal with the EU.But last month, MPs passed legislation known as the Benn Act, which requires the government to seek an extension to the negotiating process from Brussels, if Parliament does not agree to any deal with the EU - or back a no-deal Brexit - before 19 October.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tried to call a general election, arguing it would break the Brexit impasse.But opposition MPs have rejected this, meaning an election cannot go ahead at present.Mr Corbyn said: ""After an election, a Labour government would introduce legislation to ensure a referendum takes place.""He also said: ""The second referendum is what we propose under a Labour government, when it's been elected, which would be not a choice between a no-deal cliff edge but between an intelligent arrangement with the European Union and Remain so that people would have a choice.""Our absolute priority - and that's why I've been talking to other opposition parties - is to make sure that no-deal is taken off the table and an extension of membership is attained.""Mr Corbyn said Mr Johnson could not be trusted to abide by the terms of the Benn Act.He added: ""We can't trust you not to use the period of an election campaign to drive our country off a no-deal cliff edge that will crash our economy, destroy jobs and industries, cause shortages of medicine and food and endanger peace in Northern Ireland.""So it's simple: obey the law, take no-deal off the table and then let's have the election.""Earlier, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said - in contrast to Mr Corbyn - that she could ""see the sense"" in having another referendum on Brexit before a general election. Asked if she was lobbying her leader to support this series of events, she said: ""A number of us are trying to think of a way through this.""Plans for governmentDuring his appearance in Northampton, Mr Corbyn also delivered what he called his ""alternative Queen's Speech"".

He also said Mr Johnson's decision to holding the actual Queen's Speech - which outlines the government's priorities at the start of a parliamentary year - next Monday was a ""cynical stunt"", coming before an expected general election.  He accused the prime minister of ""using the Queen to deliver a pre-election party political broadcast"".But Downing Street says next Monday's event is a chance to set out plans for the NHS, schools, tackling crime, investing in infrastructure and building a strong economy."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar are holding further talks to discuss the UK's Brexit proposals.Downing Street said the meeting would allow ""detailed discussions"" on the process of securing a deal.Mr Johnson has said he remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about a deal.But on Wednesday EU leaders accused the UK of putting forward untested ideas, adding that progress towards a new deal had been limited. A similar sentiment was expressed on Tuesday by Mr Varadkar, who suggested it would be ""very difficult"" for the UK and the EU to reach a Brexit agreement before the 31 October deadline.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ""behaviour and language"" used by the PM ""suggests he's not going to reach an agreement with the European Union"".But Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith called for MPs and commentators to ""step back"" and ""give this meeting space"".

The meeting between the two leaders is taking place in the north-west of England, with Mr Johnson still insisting the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of the month.That is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October.On Wednesday, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said the PM was gearing up to bypass legal obstacles to a no-deal Brexit by sending one letter requesting an extension and, in the same instance, submitting a second memo telling European leaders he does not want one.Asked on ITV's Peston programme whether the idea of sending two letters to the EU was a possible loophole, Ms Leadsom replied: ""Absolutely.""

""Much of it is stuff which has already been tried with the EU in the past and rejected in the past,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

What are the PM's border plans? Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
Updating MEPs on the state of talks, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he believed ""with goodwill"" on both sides there could be an agreement in the run-up to the EU summit later this month.But he added: ""To put things very frankly and to try to be objective, we are not really in a position where we are able to find an agreement.""
EU heading for no-deal by mistake, Jeremy Hunt warns
What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?
How could a no-deal Brexit happen?
As it stood, he continued, the UK was proposing replacing an ""operable, practical and legal solution"" to avoid a hard Irish border with ""one that is simply a temporary solution"".Mr Barnier said the UK's suggested alternative to the Irish backstop - which would see customs checks conducted away from the border at business premises or electronically - ""had not been tested"" and was ""largely based"" on exemptions for small businesses and technology that had ""yet to be developed"".
'Prospect of a deal looks remote'
The prospect of securing an agreement that would allow the UK to leave the European Union with a deal three weeks today - on 31 October - looks remote, and few believe there is much prospect of a major breakthrough on Thursday. Each side's plan is rejected by the other, and the EU Summit - where any deal would have to be signed off - is just a week away. With time in such short supply, the focus is turning to what happens next, how the government might seek to frustrate Parliament's desire to stop an imminent no-deal Brexit, and how soon - whatever happens - a general election might follow. For more analysis, read BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's blog.
In a speech in Northampton, Mr Corbyn reiterated that his party would agree to a general election as soon as no-deal has been taken ""off the table"", as the PM ""can't be trusted not to break the law"".He also accused Mr Johnson of ""using the Queen"" to deliver a ""pre-election Tory party political broadcast"" at next week's state opening of Parliament.He told party supporters that the government had ""no obvious means"" of getting new laws passed, and holding a Queen's Speech before an election was a ""cynical stunt.""

""There have been some pretty horrendous things said about me.""An emotional Jeff Wright addressed his congregation at Green Pastures Church in Ballymena late last month.The pastor has been at the centre of a storm over the the future of bus-making firm Wrightbus, of which he was the majority shareholder.Known locally as Pastor Jeff, the former Wrightbus director says he has been the subject of death threats since the company entered administration, putting 1,200 people out of work.The company was started in 1946 from a tin shed in Ballymena by Robert Wright and his son, William - now Sir William Wright, and Jeff's father.

Bus firm faces questions over religious donations
Despite his own reservations he did not have the necessary ""wisdom"" to run the firm, Jeffrey William Wright - Sir William's only son - always seemed destined to take over the family firm.Born in July 1963 he after studied at the nearby Cambridge House Grammar before going to Ballymena Tech, and then began to work in the factory.Along with his father and two sisters, Jeff Wright said he ""fought to build this company from when I was a big skinny 19-year-old apprentice in a boiler suit"". 'Pastor and visionary'A talented footballer, he played as a forward for his hometown Ballymena United from 1984 to 1985, and Coleraine Football Club from 1987 to 1988.But there are few other details publicly available about his development as a businessman - or a preacher.He sometimes worshipped at Whitewell Metropolitan Tabernacle in Belfast and its founder, James McConnell, was at the Green Pastures service on Sunday to lend his support.In 2007, the married father-of-two set up Green Pastures. The evangelical church's website describes him as its ""lead pastor, founder and visionary"".It's hard not to draw parallel with another famous son of Ballymena.Like the late firebrand founder of the Free Presbyterian Church, Ian Paisley, Pastor Jeff set up the Church from scratch.

Jeff Wright has described Green Pastures as ""a place of refuge for the thousands of people that need, as I did, to find Jesus"". The Church has been praised for its community work: Its charity, Connect, is known for helping the vulnerable and partners with the Ballymena Foodbank.It is perhaps not surprising that in Northern Ireland, a society drawn so much on religious lines, that the Church's plans to create its own self-contained village were approved.Bought in 2012, the 100-acre site beside the A26 outside Ballymena is impossible to miss.When finished, The Gateway aims to offer social housing, shops, a hotel, riverside restaurants, an education centre and a nursing home.The project has been dogged by complaints from local shopkeepers about its impact on local business.The plans were scaled back in 2015, with a proposed supermarket being scrapped.But how The Gateway - and Green Pastures - will be affected by Wrightbus's future remains unclear. God the shareholderThe Wright family says the collapse of the business was due to a fall in demand for buses.But some workers have expressed concern that money donated to the Church weakened the business.

Wrightbus founder Sir William Wright was applauded by protestors in Ballymena last Sunday
""We made God a shareholder in the business - 26% of Wrights is owned by an evangelical trust - in order to make sure He was central in everything the Wrights company does,"" the pastor told the Irish Times in 2017.Green Pastures received £15m in donations from The Wrightbus Group over six years.In 2016-2017, about £4m was donated to the Church by the Wright Group's parent firm, the Cornerstone Group Ltd, which reported a pre-tax loss of £1.73m in the same financial reporting period.One local source, who did not wish to be named, said: ""It's one thing to give money to the Church in boom times but why when it was losing money?""There have also been suggestions a potential deal to save the company was stymied by an expensive leasing clause.The Wrightbus factory is owned by a separate firm, Whirlwind Property Two, which is controlled by Jeff Wright.It is understood that potential buyers were being asked for about £1m a year to lease the property.The family denies acting unreasonably during attempts to sell the business, and negotiations are continuing in a bid to save the company.They say one bidder had agreed to lease the property before withdrawing the offer.'My beautiful wife'In Sunday 29 September's sermon, Jeff Wright defended his management of Wrightbus and rejected any accusations of wrongdoing.

Some workers have expressed concern that donations to the church weakened the business
""I have my faults and many many failings and had many mess ups -  just ask my beautiful wife,"" he told a packed congregation at Green Pastures.""But it seems strange to me: why I would jeopardise 74 years of blood sweat and tears to make the company great and even see my own son (and) the fourth generation of Wrights lose their inheritance?"" Mr Wright said those who criticised him did not know him.""I have learnt from dad there is a time to speak and a time to be silent, especially since there are still some great people working very, very hard to not just keep the delicate negotiations alive but also to try to bring a new investor to the table.""'Nowhere to go'As he spoke, accompanied by a softly playing pianist, a different narrative was playing out metres away.
Hundreds of people were protesting outside the church - and they are angry. One former Wrightbus worker said they were there because they had ""nowhere to go, nobody to see"" and they wanted answers.While protestors waved signs and placards daubed with allegations about Jeff Wright, the mood towards the company was not all negative.Sir William Wright was applauded as he stopped to speak to some of the protesters on his way into the church.Even amid the social media outrage, there was little criticism of the 92-year-old.His grand-daughter, Fiona Knowles, stood in solidarity with workers outside the church - and suggested there were divisions in the family.""Our family has been destroyed by this and it could have been avoided,"" she said.""It is hard to watch, when you watch your granda who has built this place up since he was 16, to have it destroyed, it is very hard to watch.""Locally, Jeff Wright is much more associated with Green Pastures than he is with the company, says Dessie Blackadder, the editor of the Ballymena Guardian.Yet it was Jeff Wright's name that features most prominently on the protest placards.Pastor Jeff recently posted a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln on his Facebook page.""My concern is not whether God is on our side; my greatest concern is to be on God's side, for God is always right."""

Mr de Ficchy said Nissan still intended to build in Sunderland, the UK's biggest car plant, but that it was difficult to plan for the future amid Brexit uncertainty.The new Juke has been designed and manufactured in the UK, aimed specifically at European markets, with two-thirds of its components coming from the EU and 70% of production destined for the continent.""If a no-deal scenario means the sudden application of WTO tariffs, we know in that case our business model won't be sustainable in the future,"" said Mr de Ficchy.""Our industry works with lower margins and if we are in a situation in which tomorrow we have to apply 10% export duties to 70% of our production, the entire business model for Nissan Europe will be in jeopardy.""That's the reason why we continue to work with all scenarios.""'Not sustainable'The car industry is the UK's biggest exporter of goods and eight out of every 10 cars built in the UK are exported,Mr de Ficchy said WTO tariffs would ""represent a significant increase on our vehicles that will have to face the competition in Europe and they won't be affordable.""He said the business was asking for tariffs not be imposed if there is a no-deal Brexit.""We are asking not to have tariffs being applied in a no-deal scenario because otherwise the tariffs won't be sustainable for us,"" he said.On Wednesday, union leaders revealed night shifts at Sunderland would end - but Mr Ficchy said this was not the result of Brexit."

How are the UK's talks with the EU going?
A joint statement issued after the meeting between Mr Johnson and Mr Varadkar in north-west England said the prime minister and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) had a ""detailed and constructive discussion"".
""Both continue to believe that a deal is in everybody's interest,"" the statement said. ""They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.""The talks concentrated on ""the challenges of customs and consent"", Downing Street said.Mr Johnson has insisted the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of the month.That is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October.On Wednesday, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom suggested the PM was gearing up to bypass legal obstacles to a no-deal Brexit by sending one letter requesting an extension and, in the same instance, submitting a second memo telling European leaders he does not want one.Asked on ITV's Peston programme whether the idea of sending two letters to the EU was a possible loophole, Ms Leadsom replied: ""Absolutely.""

Mr Johnson put forward fresh proposals for a Brexit deal last week, but Mr Varadkar has said ""big gaps"" remain between the UK and the EU.Former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond accused Mr Johnson of tabling a proposed deal that ""is not going to fly, and was never going to fly"". ""Much of it is stuff which has already been tried with the EU in the past and rejected in the past,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

What are the PM's border plans? Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:
Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021
But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves
This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years
Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks
These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""
Updating MEPs on the state of talks, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he believed ""with goodwill"" on both sides there could be an agreement in the run-up to the EU summit later this month.But he added: ""To put things very frankly and to try to be objective, we are not really in a position where we are able to find an agreement.""

How could a no-deal Brexit happen?
As it stood, he continued, the UK was proposing replacing an ""operable, practical and legal solution"" to avoid a hard Irish border with ""one that is simply a temporary solution"".Mr Barnier said the UK's suggested alternative to the Irish backstop - which would see customs checks conducted away from the border at business premises or electronically - ""had not been tested"" and was ""largely based"" on exemptions for small businesses and technology that had ""yet to be developed"".In a speech in Northampton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated that his party would agree to a general election as soon as no-deal has been taken ""off the table"", as the PM ""can't be trusted not to break the law"".He also accused Mr Johnson of ""using the Queen"" to deliver a ""pre-election Tory party political broadcast"" at next week's state opening of Parliament.He told party supporters that the government had ""no obvious means"" of getting new laws passed, and holding a Queen's Speech before an election was a ""cynical stunt.""

Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith told BBC NI's The View he was ""delighted to see the positivity that came out of the meeting"" between Mr Johnson and Mr Varadkar.He added: ""We do need to compromise, we do need to focus on coming together and having an accommodation.""Mr Varadkar had earlier refused to be drawn on what ""concessions"" had been made by either side.

The Queen will announce the government's intended new laws for the year ahead
Policies on crime, immigration, health and the environment form the heart of Boris Johnson's new legislative agenda, to be unveiled in the Queen's Speech.Plans to end the free movement of EU citizens to the UK after Brexit and provide faster access to medicines will also be among 22 new bills announced at the State Opening of Parliament.Ministers say it is an ambitious programme for a post-Brexit Britain.But with the PM having no majority, many of the bills may not become law.And the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said there was no guarantee the Queen's Speech - which is written by the government - would be approved by Parliament. If MPs reject it, it will trigger renewed calls for a general election.
Labour has described the whole exercise as a political ""stunt"".

Despite continuing Brexit uncertainty, the government has said it is determined to press ahead with its plans, announcing its intention to hold a Budget on 6 November. Negotiations over the UK's departure from the EU continue, with the UK trying to secure an agreement that will enable the UK to leave by 31 October.The government says if it can strike a deal with the EU, it will introduce a withdrawal agreement bill and aim to secure its passage through Parliament before the Halloween deadline. Intensive talks over the weekend failed to produce a breakthrough, with EU officials openly discussing the prospect of a further extension and the PM saying ""a significant amount of work"" remained.

Boris Johnson's government does not have a majority in the Commons
The Queen will officially announce the government's legislative agenda for the year ahead when she opens the new session of Parliament at 11.30 BST. The occasion is famous for its pageantry - with the monarch arriving at the Palace of Westminster in a carriage procession and delivering her speech from the throne in the House of Lords. Mr Johnson, whose government took office in July, has said the Queen's Speech will focus on ""seizing the opportunities that Brexit present"".The 22 bills are expected to include:
An Immigration and Social Co-ordination Bill to end freedom of movement and bring in a points-based immigration system from 2021. EU citizens arriving after January 2021 would be subject to the same immigration controls as non-EU citizens, based on people's skills. The immigration status of Irish citizens will be clarified once free movement rules are removed.
Tougher penalties for foreign national offenders who try to return to the UK after being deported.
Scrapping the rail franchise system - the contracting out of services introduced when the rail system was privatised in the 1990s. Reforms will focus on getting trains to run on time, a simplified fares system, a new commercial model and industry structure, and new proposals for ""a skilled, diverse and engaged workforce"".
Plans for an independent NHS investigations body with legal powers - the Health Service Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) - intended to improve patient safety, and a pledge to update the Mental Health Act to reduce the number of detentions made under the act.
An environment bill that will set legally binding targets to reduce plastics, cut air pollution, restore biodiversity and improve water quality.
Measures to tackle electoral fraud, including requiring people to show some form of ID before voting.
There are also proposals for tougher sentences for serious and violent crime, improve building standards, and increase investment in infrastructure and science.""Getting Brexit done by 31 October is absolutely crucial,"" Mr Johnson said ahead of the ceremony.""But the people of this country don't just want us to sort out Brexit... this optimistic and ambitious Queen's Speech sets us on a course to make all that happen, and more besides.""Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly is urging opposition MPs not to reject the government's programme - which includes four bills carried over from the last session - saying they should ""put differences over Brexit aside and give Parliament the power to get our country moving forward"".But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Sky News the whole exercise was a waste of time. ""Having a Queen's Speech and a State Opening of Parliament tomorrow is ludicrous,"" he said. ""What we have got in effect is a party political broadcast from the steps of the throne.""
A different Queen's Speech

Preparations for the ceremony have been taking place
By the BBC's political correspondent Nick EardleyThis Queen's Speech will feel rather different. Boris Johnson does not have a majority in Parliament and cannot guarantee that he will be able to pass all the bills announced this morning.There is no guarantee the Queen's Speech itself will even pass. Add into the mix the fact that he wants a general election and some of what you will hear will feel more like a pitch to the country than a concrete plan for the next year in Whitehall. There is also the fact that whatever is announced in the House of Lords could quickly be overshadowed by what happens in Brussels.A lot has been spoken about crucial weeks at Westminster. This really feels like it could be one - where key questions are answered. Can the PM get a new Brexit deal? If so, can he persuade Parliament to back it? If not, can MPs force him to delay Brexit again?Strap yourself in - it could be a bumpy few days."

The government's independent financial watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which produces economic forecasts for the Budget would normally get ten weeks notice to prepare.The OBR said it was able to prepare some information in advance, but that its forecasts would be based on the UK securing a Brexit deal. It said since the EU referendum, its forecasts had been based on ""broad brush assumptions for a relatively smooth [Brexit] outcome"". The OBR said that approach would continue ""in the absence of any specific information"".Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he expected the Budget to be ""an electioneering stunt rather than a Budget to rebuild our stalling economy and reset the direction of our country"".The Budget is the government's yearly announcement on its plans for tax and spending for the coming financial year, which starts in April 2020.There are expectations that the chancellor could relax the government's borrowing rules to give him more spending power.The rules state that borrowing should remain below 2% of national income, at about £46bn.
Mr Javid has already suggested he is prepared to borrow more to take advantage of current record-low borrowing costs, and has previously said he plans to review the borrowing rules.In August's spending review, Mr Javid declared the government had ""turned the page on austerity, announcing its largest increase in spending for 15 years.
Naming the date of a Budget is a sign from the chancellor to communicate that at least some Treasury business continues as normal.But there is nothing routine about a government yet to win a vote in the Commons, trying to pass a Budget.In theory there will be measures to boost infrastructure, spending and some taxes. But if there is a no-deal Brexit, the Treasury will instead turn its focus on giving immediate support to the economy, businesses and households.So, in that case, there would be a delay to the Budget.In a no-deal scenario, there might be some extra scope for a cut to VAT which could be part of a general fiscal stimulus package for the economy.Whatever happens, a new set of Budget numbers and economic forecasts is being prepared by the government's independent financial watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The Bank of England too will be preparing its new forecasts for the 7 November Inflation Report, and any implications for interest rates.The Treasury will also reveal its new self-imposed constraints on borrowing - ""fiscal rules""- designed to help create more space for spending and tax cuts.And if there is a Budget a week after a Brexit deal has passed the Commons, there could be a chance that the government could get support for its fiscal measures too.  Or rather it could be part of the pathway to a general election next month."

2019/10/16 23:54:04,15:51 ,Northern rail could be nationalised,"Close share panel

The government is considering whether the management of the North of England's largest rail commuter service should be taken into public hands. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Northern's poor performance, with trains regularly arriving late or not at all, ""cannot continue"".Mr Shapps said he had issued a ""request for proposals"" from the firm and the Operator of Last Resort (OLR).This could lead to services being brought into direct government control.Giving evidence to the Commons' Transport Select Committee, Mr Shapps said: ""As a fellow long-suffering commuter, I entirely believe we cannot carry on just thinking it is OK for trains not to arrive, or Sunday services not to be in place. That has to change.""
The Department for Transport confirmed it was developing contingency plans for the replacement of the current franchise ""with either a new short-term management contract with Northern or the Operator of Last Resort (OLR)"".""In the context of significant challenges facing the operator, such as delays to infrastructure upgrades and historic underinvestment in the northern rail network, issuing a request for proposal enables the department to examine whether the contract is properly aligned with current operating challenges in the North,"" it said.""It also allows us to determine whether the franchise owner or an OLR would be best placed to tackle these issues and deliver for passengers.""David Brown, managing director at Northern, said the firm had faced several challenges in the past couple of years, outside the direct control of Northern. The most significant of these is the continuing late delivery of major infrastructure upgrades, including the North West electrification, which is more than two years late.Mr Brown added: ""Arriva and Northern remain fully committed to delivering the transformation of the North's railways and improving customers' experience. We are delivering the biggest transformation of local rail for a generation.""
This is another black mark for Britain's rail system. A second franchise, potentially brought under government control is not what Conservative ministers wanted. Labour will press its argument that the system is so broken that the same should happen to all train companies.But Northern (a large commuter network) is a much more complex franchise than the East Coast Mainline (intercity services) which the government took control of last year and rebranded LNER. For that reason the government is probably keen to stop short of the ""full public control"" option and take-on a more supervisory role, with Arriva (Northern's parent company) still in charge of the day-to-day. But several leading politicians argue Northern has failed and therefore should be removed wholesale from managing the franchise. Northern argues the system is at fault because delayed infrastructure upgrades (managed by publicly-owned Network Rail) have not allowed it to run the services passengers demand. There is no silver bullet to fixing the railways but the government-commissioned rail review will, in a matter of weeks, attempt to come up with answers. Northern, which is one of the biggest franchises in the country, has been in trouble for years. Industry sources have confirmed to the BBC that the train company, which is owned by Arriva, has been losing money for some time. Passenger numbers on Northern dropped after the botched introduction of new timetables in the summer of last year. Mr Shapps said: ""If you are northern, and you are a Northern passenger, you're as frustrated as I was in 2018. With Northern it has failed to recover.""On Friday, Transport for the North said it believed the franchise should be taken into public hands, via what is known as an Operator of Last Resort (OLR). The OLR is, on behalf of the government, currently in charge of London North East Railway, the East Coast Mainline intercity franchise.However, the OLR is not the only option for the government. It could also opt for what is known as a ""management contract"", which would mean that Arriva would still operate rail services, but the Department for Transport would adopt a much more hands-on role for the operation of the franchise. The OLR has been monitoring Northern for some time and any change to the operation of the franchise would take months to implement. A review of the railways in the UK is already under way. The Williams Review, led by former British Airways boss Keith Williams, is due to publish its findings in coming weeks. It is expected that the rail franchise system will be completely overhauled, a point mentioned in the Queen's Speech earlier this week."

Media captionDUP's Sammy Wilson raises concerns about Brexit deal
The future of Boris Johnson's Brexit deal hangs in the balance as EU officials say the outcome of talks should be known by the end of the day.European Council President Donald Tusk said he would have ""bet"" on a deal 24 hours ago, but ""certain doubts had appeared on the British side"".The PM has been trying to get the Democratic Unionists on board for his revised plan for Northern Ireland.He is in a race against time to get a deal before Thursday's EU summit.Mr Johnson has been updating his cabinet on the state of the negotiations after further talks with the DUP, whose support is crucial if Parliament is to approve any agreement.
The BBC understands ministers were not briefed on the full contents of the proposed deal because the situation in Brussels is still fluid.The PM, who told ministers there was ""a chance of securing a good deal but we are not there yet"", has also briefly addressed a meeting of Conservative MPs.

Kuenssberg: Brexit has a new phrase - 'difficult but possible'
What are the backstop options?
The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier was due to brief EU ministers at lunch time but this meeting has been put back twice - and will not now take place until 18:00 BST.Differences remain on proposed customs and tax arrangements, and how to get support for them in Northern Ireland.
There are all sorts of briefings, but there are very few briefings from the people who have direct knowledge of the conversations taking place.What I am not hearing is that the DUP have signed up to the latest proposals.Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds were in Downing Street this morning.As I understand it, they did not leave thinking this issue of consent had been sorted.This is not over, this is not done, but crucially it is still ongoing.No one is upping stumps just yet.Read more from Laura
The issue of the Irish border - and how to handle the flow of goods and people across it once it becomes the border between the UK and the EU after Brexit - has long been a sticking point in the negotiations.The border is also a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland.The backstop - the solution to border issues agreed by Theresa May - proved unpalatable to many MPs so Mr Johnson has come up with new proposals to dispense with it.

However, they would see Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK - something the DUP, among others, has great concerns about.The BBC's Brussels reporter, Adam Fleming, says there has been a shift in emphasis in the Brussels talks away from issues around customs towards matters surrounding the so-called consent mechanism - the idea the prime minister came up with to give communities in Northern Ireland a regular say over whatever comes into effect.The DUP is understood to be most concerned about this issue too. The party also fears the creation of a ""customs border"" in the Irish Sea, which would require checks on goods between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland.  The DUP are due to issue a statement later, following their latest round of talks in Downing Street. After a 90-minute meeting on Tuesday, they said ""it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required"".Party leader Arlene Foster dismissed suggestions that their concerns had since been allayed.

They said the most they could do was give a provisional thumbs-up - ""a political yes"" - to whatever emerges from the talks pending the release of the final legal text. 'Foundations ready'But Mr Tusk suggested an agreement was still possible within the next few hours.""Theoretically in seven to eight hours everything should be clear,"" he told the TVN 24 News Channel. ""It is still undergoing changes and the basic foundations of this agreement are ready and theoretically we could accept a deal tomorrow.""Thursday's summit is crucial because under legislation passed last month - the Benn Act - Mr Johnson is compelled to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit if he does not get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturday.

Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs on Wednesday that Mr Johnson ""will comply with the law"" regarding the terms of any further extension. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who earlier spoke to Mr Johnson, also suggested there was still ""more time"" for a breakthrough.""There is a pathway to a possible deal but there are many issues that still need to be fully resolved, particularly around the consent mechanism and also some issues around customs and VAT,"" he said at an agri-food event in Dublin.""I do think we are making progress, but there are issues yet to be resolved.""

If Mr Johnson gets an agreement, he will ask MPs to back it and agree the next steps in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday. No 10 has confirmed the government will table a motion in the Commons on Thursday which, if approved by MPs, would pave the way for the first weekend session since 1982. However, MPs may not be asked to sanction the extra sitting if there is not a successful conclusion to the Brexit talks.

Earlier, former Brexit Secretary David Davis said the support of Tory Eurosceptics could not be taken for granted and MPs would subject any agreement to ""two or three key tests"" - including whether it compromised the future of the United Kingdom.""Quite a lot of Tory MPs will take their line from what the DUP say,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""If the DUP say this is intolerable, that will be quite important.""Meanwhile, a cross-party group of MPs has arrived in Brussels to make the case for another extension to the Brexit process even if Parliament approves a deal on Saturday.One of the group, ex-Conservative minister Dominic Grieve, told Sky News the PM was trying to ""bamboozle"" everyone into thinking the process of ratifying any agreement in UK law could be concluded by 31 October when it ""plainly cannot""."

Nobody can ever understand how difficult it is to lose a child in this way"".She became engaged to Whoriskey just five days before the death of Kayden.Her son died as a result of fifteen blunt trauma injuries which caused a bleeding and a swelling of his brain. He sustained the injuries while he was in the sole care of Whoriskey.Judge Philip Babington excused the 11 jurors for life and said he would sentence Whoriskey following a plea hearing on 29 November.There was a noticeable police presence as both families traded insults on the way out."

The government has dropped a plan to use strict age verification checks to stop under-18s viewing porn online.It said the policy, which was initially set to launch in April 2018, would ""not be commencing"" after repeated delays, and fears it would not work.The so-called porn blocker would have forced commercial porn providers to verify users' ages, or face a UK ban.Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan said other measures would be deployed to achieve the same objectives.The government first mooted the idea of a porn blocker in 2015, with the aim of stopping youngsters ""stumbling across"" inappropriate content.
Pornographic sites which failed to check the age of UK visitors would have faced being blocked by internet service providers.

But critics warned that many under-18s would have found it relatively easy to bypass the restriction using virtual private networks (VPNs), which disguise their location, or could simply turn to porn-hosting platforms not covered by the law, such as Reddit or Twitter.Likewise, platforms which host pornography on a non-commercial basis - meaning they do not charge a fee or make money from adverts - would not have been affected.

There were concerns users would have had to upload scans of their passports
There were also privacy concerns, amid suggestions that websites could ask users to upload scans of their passports or driving licences.In a written statement issued on Wednesday, Ms Morgan said the government would not be ""commencing Part 3 of the Digital Economy Act 2017 concerning age verification for online pornography"".Instead, she said, porn providers would be expected to meet a new ""duty of care"" to improve online safety. This will be policed by a new online regulator ""with strong enforcement powers to deal with non-compliance"".""This course of action will give the regulator discretion on the most effective means for companies to meet their duty of care,"" she added.OCL, one of the firms offering age verification tools, was not happy about the decision.""It is shocking that the government has now done a U-turn and chosen not to implement [this],"" said chief executive Serge Acker.""There is no legitimate reason not to implement legislation which has been on the statue books for two years and was moments away from enactment this summer. [This] would have protected children against seeing pornography on the internet, a move which would undoubtedly have been welcomed by all sensible parents in the UK.""But Jim Killock, executive director of civil liberties organisation Open Rights Group, welcomed the news. ""Age verification for porn as currently legislated would cause huge privacy problems if it went ahead. We are glad the government has stepped back from creating a privacy disaster, that would lead to blackmail scams and individuals being outed for the sexual preferences.""However it is still unclear what the government does intend to do, so we will remain vigilant to ensure that new proposals are not just as bad, or worse."" In June, the porn blocker was delayed a second time after the government failed to tell European regulators about the plan, leading Labour to describe the policy as an ""utter shambles""."

Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said Labour's nationalisation plans would be cost-neutral
Labour's nationalisation plans would cost at least £196bn, according to the Confederation of British Industry.The employers' group said the up-front cost of taking control of the water and energy utilities, train firms and Royal Mail was equivalent to all income tax paid by UK citizens in a year.It was the combined total of the £141bn health budget, and the £61bn spent on education, analysis by the CBI said.A Labour Party spokesman said it was ""incoherent scaremongering"" by the CBI.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said that nationalisation would be cost-neutral as the companies' profits would cover the cost of borrowing needed to finance it.
In addition, the party has said that rail nationalisation, for example, would be hugely popular with travellers tired of poor services. And bringing National Grid back under state control would be part of plans to create a National Energy Agency to help usher in Labour's proposed Green Industrial Revolution.Labour's shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the CBI had ""chosen to fabricate false information about Labour's rail policy"" by suggesting that the party was advocating buying rolling stock instead of leasing it.He added: ""The CBI's shoddy research and shabby conduct does a great disservice to our political debate during the hugely challenging times through which we now live.""But a CBI spokesperson said the organisation stood by its analysis, adding: ""The cost of purchasing rolling stock is a fraction of the £196bn and was included as that is what full-scale renationalisation of the rail industry would likely involve. ""If a Labour government chose not to purchase the rolling stock, they would still need to pay the cost of leasing them.""Investor confidence 'severely hit'The CBI's report estimated there could be a 10.7% increase in debt from bringing industries back into public ownership.This would raise debt levels to 94% of GDP, the highest point since the 1960s, and would cost about £2bn a year, according to the study.It also said that under Labour's plans, savers and pensioners could suffer an estimated £9bn loss to their holdings, which translates into £327 for every household in the country.The CBI bases its analysis on the nationalisation of:
Nine water and sewerage companies and seven water-only companies in England
National Grid, and the electricity transmission and distribution networks
Rail rolling stock
Royal Mail
The report said the confidence of international investors in the UK would be ""severely hit"" if Labour refused to pay full market value for the industries.

Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, called the price tag ""eye-watering"". And she said that £196bn was only the starting point. ""It doesn't take into account the maintenance and development of the infrastructure, the trickle-down hit to pension pots and savings accounts, or the impact on the country's public finances.Fair economy""There are so many other genuine priorities for public spending right now, from investing in our young people to the transition to low carbon economy and connecting our cities and communities.""These issues are what keep businesses up at night and what they want to see the government get on with addressing. Nationalisation would waste time, energy and public money.""Last week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested that focusing on the upfront cost of Labour's plans was the wrong approach. ""Economically what matters is whether these assets would be better managed by the public or the private sector,"" it said."

Peter Jones bought Jessops out of administration in 2013
Dragons Den star Peter Jones, who owns camera chain Jessops, plans to call in administrators to help secure the future of the High Street brand.Mr Jones bought the chain from administrators in 2013 after it collapsed under £81m of debt.While revenues have increased most years since then, profits fell to less than £10,000 last year.Now Mr Jones reportedly plans to seek a rescue deal for the firm's property arm, JR Prop Limited.The division has reported a steep increase in rental costs since 2017.

Empty shops hit highest level for four years
Now Mr Jones is reportedly planning to seek a rescue deal, known as a company voluntary agreement (CVA) with its landlords and lenders. This is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts and is often used as an opportunity to renegotiate rents.Sky News said the CVA was expected to lead to store closures and rent cuts.But sources close to Jessops, which employs around 500 people, said Mr Jones still saw a future in the business and would not say how many of the chain's 46 stores were at risk of closure.

Media captionWhen he bought the business in 2013, Peter Jones said it was a ""great day for British retail""
Mr Jones bought Jessops in March 2013, just months after it had gone into administration and closed its 187 stores.At the time, he said the chain would reopen some of its High Street shops to give it between 30 and 40 stores across the country. He told the BBC that he wanted the price charged in store to be the same as online.Asked then whether there really was a market for cameras that were not integrated into mobile phones, Mr Jones said: ""The amateur photographer, you wouldn't see them walking down the street taking that perfect picture with a mobile phone.""But interest did not live up to his expectations.He forecasted sales of at least £80m in the first year under his control. But he failed to turn around the group's performance and the firm reported lacklustre turnover of £57.9m for the period.However, in 2016, the firm's revenues did reach £80.3m. The next year they surpassed £95m before dipping slightly amid tough trading conditions on the High Street.The chain is the latest High Street brand to acknowledge tough trading conditions.Last year, big chains such as Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld collapsed and vanished altogether.Others such as Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look did restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of shops between them.Who is Peter Jones?
The serial entrepreneur's first venture was to start a tennis coaching school, after spending his summers working at a tennis academy run by his English teacher
That gave him a taste for the world of business and, in his 20s, he started a computer business. That allowed him ""a nice house, a BMW, a Porsche, and plenty of money to spend"", he later wrote
But the good times didn't last forever and the firm went under after a number of its biggest customers went bust, forcing Mr Jones to move back in with his parents aged 29. He went to work for Siemens UK and a year later was running its UK computer business
But he didn't remain an employee for long and in 1998, he started Phones International, which made him millions and earned him a seat as an investor on the BBC's Dragon Den

Corinne Brown said the investment would help to make the estate she loves look more up-to-date
A housing estate where residents earn some of the lowest wages in England is set to get a £1m facelift.Shops, playing fields and homes are all due to be improved on the Treneere estate in Penzance, Cornwall, and work could start before Christmas.Housing association Live West would fund the work with the aim of improving the neighbourhood's look and feel.Corinne Brown, who runs Treneere's fish and chip shop, said it was exactly what the estate needed.
Image caption
The shopping area will be one of the first to be targeted for a facelift and it is hoped the work will be completed in time for Christmas
Under the plans, the shopping area would be renovated, new roofs would be installed on about 100 houses and more than 300 homes would be cleaned and redecorated.
Leanda Flower, from Live West, said the organisation hoped the initial investment, which was due to come from revenue funding, would be a catalyst for further investment and work.""Critical to all of this is the involvement of the community and residents here,"" she said.""There is a fantastic community here and we are really keen to harness their energy and enthusiasm and ideas into shaping the project.""Housing association bosses said they hoped there would be opportunities for residents to upskill and get involved in project planning.

The foodbank has already benefited from the plans with the housing association asking one of its contractors to carry out works to stop their store getting so damp
Treneere estate has ranked very low on the government's deprivation index. The index showed income on the estate was in the bottom 1% in the country and, according to the Office of National Statistics, employment in Penzance fell by 10.4% between 2009 and 2017.Live West has supported Penzance Foodbank, which is based in a small building behind Treneere's shops.Manager Christine Gendall said the housing association was helping the foodbank with anti-damp work in its building and was ""certainly working very hard in the community"".

About 100 homes on the estate will be getting new roofs in a bid to make energy bills more affordable for residents while another 300 homes will be redecorated and cleaned
Debbie Sims, from the residents association, said: ""I think for the residents it is going to be great for them to be able to see their houses look a bit nicer aesthetically. ""For people coming through the estate it is going to look really nice. I am really excited."""
