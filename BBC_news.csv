A woman is trying to knit 2,020 jumpers and cardigans in a year to donate to child refugees.Eileen Johnson, 79, from Cardigan, Ceredigion, said she got the idea from a giant cardigan knitted in 2011 to mark the town's 900th anniversary.She spends some of her time sitting in the window of a cafe knitting and teaches children who may come in.More than 100 items have been knitted among her team of volunteers and the aim is to complete by September 2020.""I was born during the war and my mum taught me how to knit while in the air raid shelter when I was three years old,"" she said.

Single malt Scotch whisky exported to the United States is to face a tariff of 25% from 18 October.The new duty is part of a raft of measures being imposed by the US in retaliation against EU subsidies given to aircraft maker Airbus.Other goods being targeted include cashmere sweaters, dairy products, pork, books and some machinery.Scotch exports to the US last year were worth $1.3bn (£1bn), with single malts accounting for a large share of that. The US was given the go-ahead to impose tariffs on $7.5bn (£6.1bn) of goods it imports from the EU following a World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling on Wednesday.
It is the latest chapter in a 15-year battle between the US and the EU over illegal subsidies for planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing.

The ruling by the WTO will mean tariffs on EU goods ranging from aircraft to agricultural products.Brussels has threatened to retaliate similarly against US goods.'Serious situation'Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said it was a blow to the Scotch whisky sector.""This is a serious situation for the industry,"" she said. ""We heard overnight that a 25% import tariff will be imposed on all single malts into the United States and also all Scotch whisky liqueurs, and that's from a position of zero. ""We've had a zero tariff on imports to the United States for the past 25 years, so this is quite a hike.""The Scotch whisky industry directly employs about 11,000 people in Scotland, and many more indirectly through its supply chain.More than 7,000 of the jobs are in rural areas across the country.A spokesman for the UK's Department for International Trade said: ""Resorting to tariffs is not in the interests of the UK, EU or US. ""The UK is working closely with the US, EU and European partners to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing disputes.""The UK, through the EU, is seeking confirmation from the WTO that we have complied fully with WTO rulings regarding support to Airbus, and should not be subject to tariffs.""How did this row start?

Airbus' A380 was unfairly subsidised, WTO says
The US first filed the case in 2004, arguing that cheap European loans for Airbus amounted to illegal state subsidies.The WTO decided in favour of the US, which subsequently complained that the EU and certain member countries were not in compliance with the decision, prompting years of further wrangling.The US had sought to impose tariffs on about $11bn in goods. Though the WTO cut that figure to $7.5bn, Wednesday's decision still marks the largest penalty of its kind in the organisation's history.The WTO's dispute settlement body must formally adopt the ruling but is not expected to overturn the decision."

Roger Jenkins was chairman of investment banking in the Middle East
Three former top Barclays executives are due in court on Monday charged with fraud linked to how the bank raised billions of pounds from Qatar in 2008.The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) case centres on alleged undisclosed payments to Qatar in return for cash that helped the bank during the financial crisis.Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris, and Richard Boath all deny wrongdoing.    Former Barclays chief executive John Varley, their co-defendant in a previous trial, was acquitted in June.The SFO's criminal proceedings against the bank itself were also dismissed by a court last year. Mr Varley and Barclays had each denied wrongdoing.
Mr Jenkins, 64, was the chairman of investment banking in the Middle East, while Mr Kalaris, 63, headed the wealth division and Mr Boath, 60, led the European corporate finance arm.The trio is each charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation.Former Barclays head cleared of fraud chargesThe case centres on claims of secret payments to Qatar as part of a deal to raise more than £11bn ($13.6bn) from investors in two tranches in June and October 2008.It is claimed that these multi-million pound payments to investors, including to the then prime minister of the Gulf state, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, were not property disclosed to the markets.The cash injection from Qatar helped Barclays avoid the government bailout fate of High Street rivals, including Royal Bank of Scotland.The defendants were charged in 2017 after the SFO spent years investigating the allegations. The trial is regarded as a high stakes case for the SFO, which has been accused of failing to pursue companies and individuals over their part in the financial crisis.The charges against Mr Jenkins relate to his involvement in the June and October Qatar fundraisings. The cases of the two other men relate to the June fundraising only.Monday's Old Bailey trial will start with jury selection, and the case is expected to last several months."

A chief constable has written to the US Embassy in London demanding the return of an American diplomat's wife who is a suspect in a fatal crash inquiry.Harry Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike collided with a car near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August.The diplomat's wife, named as Anne Sacoolas, left the UK despite telling police she did not plan to.Nick Adderley, of Northamptonshire Police, has urged the embassy to waive her diplomatic immunity.He said he had appealed to US authorities ""in the strongest terms"".
Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, said leaving the country was ""such a dishonourable thing to do"" and urged Ms Sacoolas to ""come back"". His father, Tim Dunn, said they needed to get the truth.Ms Charles added: ""We are not out to get her put behind bars. If that's what the justice system ends up doing then we can't stop that but we're not out to do that, we're out to try and get some peace for ourselves.""The US Embassy previously said ""security and privacy considerations"" precluded it from naming the suspect.

One in 10 consultant psychiatrist positions in Scotland are vacant, according to a new report, leading to claims the profession is facing a ""workforce crisis"". A census by the Royal College of Psychiatrists found that vacancy rates are particularly high in child and adolescent mental health services. More than one in six consultant posts (17.5%) in Camhs is vacant. Ministers say they have invested £54m in mental health services.The census found that 72 out of 747 consultant psychiatry posts (9.7%) in Scotland are vacant. In 2017, one in 16 posts (6.3%) were vacant.
Across the UK, the vacancy rate is 9.6%. Due to retireProfessor John Crichton, chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) in Scotland, said: ""We have a workforce crisis on our hands and need more junior doctors to choose psychiatry.""Simply put the supply does not meet the demand.""He said many psychiatrists were expected to retire within five years and there had been a drop in the numbers of psychiatrists choosing to progress to higher training.Junior doctors need to spend six years training before gaining consultant status, he added, which also contributes to the shortage.He said the Scottish government needed to do more.

The rate of knife attacks in some regional towns and cities is higher than in many London boroughs, BBC analysis of police figures suggests.Overall, London remains the most dangerous part of England and Wales - but data, obtained from 34 of the 43 police forces, shows the rate of serious knife crime offences rising sharply in some areas outside London, and outstripping some of the city's boroughs in places like the city of Manchester, Slough, Liverpool and Blackpool.
Ten charts on the rise of knife crime
Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims
""We are suffering just as much as anywhere else,"" said Byron Highton whose brother Jon-Jo was 18 when he was stabbed to death with a sword and an axe as he walked home in Preston, in 2014. ""The whole country is suffering from knife crime, but small cities in the north like Preston get no mention.""
Under Freedom of Information Law, the BBC asked all 43 regional police forces in England and Wales for details of serious knife crime in their area.
Serious knife crime is defined as any assault, robbery, threat to kill, murder, attempted murder or sexual offence involving a knife or sharp instrument. In Lancashire, the figures show knife crime has almost doubled in five years, rising from 455 offences in 2014, to 981 in 2018.

""The scary part is how bad is it going to be in 10 years if this generation isn't fixed.""

Manchester, Liverpool, Slough and Nottingham are all in the top 25 most dangerous places in England and Wales for serious knife crime. The safest areas with less than one crime per 10,000 people include Dorset, the Cotswolds, Monmouthshire and the Malvern.In Scotland, police collect crime statistics differently, so there are no separate records for knife attacks. However, knife possession has increased in recent years, with more than 2,300 crimes reported last year.

The girl 'threatened with a machete'It's not just young men who are affected. In Blackpool, students Keeley, 17, and Lauren, 18, have both been threatened on the estate where they live, with knives brandished in relatively trivial teenage disagreements.  ""I got threatened with a machete in a park by a group of lads when I was playing football,"" Keeley said. ""They wanted to play in our half, but we said no.""

Students Lauren (l) and Keeley have both been threatened with stabbing near their homes
Lauren says she doesn't feel safe in the town: ""Me and my mate were walking home and a guy came out and threatened to stab one of my mates.""In 2018, the resort had 14.3 serious knife crime offences per 10,000 people, putting it in the top 25 most dangerous places for knife crime in England and Wales, of the 275 areas which gave data.  Drugs gangs, school exclusion rates, poverty, unemployment and cuts to services have all been blamed for a rise in youth violence in towns like Blackpool and Preston.Last month, official figures showed eight of the 10 most deprived neighbourhoods in England were in Blackpool.  ""There is a significant issue with county lines [drugs courier] gangs in Blackpool, and from that we are seeing that means a lot of young people are carrying knives,"" Ashley Hackett, chief executive of Blackpool Football Club Community Trust , told the BBC. ""We have an awful lot of children and teenagers who are living in deprivation and whatever way they can find to earn money and support households, legally and illegally, they are doing it. That includes drugs and knives,"" he added. In 2018, almost half of all suspects in serious knife crime offences in England and Wales, were aged 24 and under.
'Emotionally exploited' The experiences of young women like Keeley and Lauren are becoming more commonplace. Last year, 15% of knife crime suspects were female and, including those attacked in domestic abuse incidents, a quarter of victims of knife crime were women. Dr Mike Rowe of Liverpool University, who has been observing police officers at work for the past six years, told the BBC: ""Girls and young women are being exploited to carry weapons because they are much less likely to be stopped and searched by police. ""The attention on male suspects may lead to the deliberate recruitment of young women.""Anti-knife crime campaigner Lydia Lawrence, who has herself survived two stabbings by two different women, agrees that gang violence is on the rise, and girls with low self-esteem are being emotionally exploited. Ms Lawrence, who's from west London, was first a victim of knife crime aged just 12, when she was cut on her face. She nearly died when she was 21, after being stabbed through her kidney and liver. Ms Lawrence, who was born in prison, excluded from school at 12 and homeless by 16, warned that girls from troubled backgrounds and broken homes are the most at risk.Dr Rowe believes police responses to knife crime have been ""seriously hampered by the cuts in the past eight years and more"", contributing to a fall in the number of cases solved.
He said that every time there is a stabbing, officers are pulled from neighbourhood teams to guard the scene as forensics are gathered. ""It's these neighbourhood teams that would normally be expected to gather the intelligence which investigations of knife crime and gang activity rely on. ""So there is a vicious cycle in which rising demands hinder the capacity to investigate those very crimes.""

People 'scared to leave homes' over drugs
Assistant Chief Constable Jackie Sebire, the national lead in tackling serious violent crime at the National Police Chiefs' Council, blamed police funding cuts for the fall in charge rates. ""The large reduction in police funding since 2010 has meant fewer detectives with less time and a bigger workload taking on long investigations, meaning it can be more difficult to get a charge.""In some cases police have fearful witnesses, and victims who do not feel able to engage with officers or the court process.""This means there is little possibility of a prosecution. ""Some forces who have been given additional funding to tackle violence are using that to improve forensic capabilities, so even when the victim is unwilling to proceed, police can still progress a case.""A Home Office spokesperson responded: ""We are taking action to tackle the violent crime which has such a devastating impact on our communities.""This includes supporting the police by recruiting 20,000 new police officers over the next three years, making it easier for them to use stop and search powers, and investing £10m in additional funding to allow forces to increase the number of officers carrying Tasers."""

Commemoration events kicked off on Saturday
New Zealand is marking a divisive anniversary - 250 years since the British explorer Captain James Cook set foot in the country.Cook and his crew of the HMS Endeavour came to shore at Gisborne on 8 October 1769 ushering in colonial rule.But New Zealand - or Aotearoa in Maori - had been populated by the Maori people for several hundred years. Some say this milestone should not be celebrated as it had a detrimental impact on the Maori community.Last week British High Commissioner Laura Clarke delivered a statement of regret to local tribes - known as iwi - over the death of nine indigenous people during the first meeting between Cook and the Maori. But she stopped short of issuing an apology.
Though James Cook's exploration of New Zealand dominates history books, Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was the first European to catch sight of it, in 1642. Maori people from Polynesian islands are believed to have arrived in New Zealand hundreds of years prior to the first Europeans.What celebrations are planned?New Zealand has planned several days of events to mark the milestone of the first meeting between Maori and Europeans. On Tuesday, a flotilla of ships including a replica of the Endeavour reached Gisborne, a city on the east coast of North Island. Members of Parliament Kelvin Davis and Kiritapu Allan went aboard to greet the crew. Protesters were also reportedly present in the town, which is also known by its Maori name of Turanga-nui-a-Kiwa.

""We were only really telling, I believe, 50% of the story, and not always telling it well,"" she said. New Zealand should continue to learn and tell the full story of its past, she added.Why is the anniversary controversial?When James Cook arrived on the Turanganui River, what is now Gisborne, the first encounter between his crew and the Maori inhabitants was deadly.A leader of the Ngati Oneone group was immediately shot and killed after what is believed to be a misunderstanding over a ceremonial challenge. At least eight other Maori were killed.

In Gisborne, a statue of Cook has been repeatedly defaced with graffiti and is to be replaced."

The demonstrators - who are demanding action on climate change - should abandon their ""hemp-smelling bivouacs"" and stop blocking roads, the PM added.Police have already arrested 280 people in London at the start of two weeks of protests by environmental campaigners.Mr Johnson made the comments at a book launch on Monday evening.""I am afraid that the security people didn't want me to come along tonight because they said the road was full of uncooperative crusties and protesters of all kinds littering the road,"" he said.
""They said there was some risk that I would be egged.""

Commemoration events kicked off on Saturday
New Zealand is marking a divisive anniversary - 250 years since the British explorer Captain James Cook set foot in the country.Cook and his crew of the HMS Endeavour came to shore at Gisborne on 8 October 1769 ushering in colonial rule.But New Zealand - or Aotearoa in Maori - had been populated by the Maori people for several hundred years. Some say this milestone should not be celebrated as it had a detrimental impact on the Maori community.Last week British High Commissioner Laura Clarke delivered a statement of regret to local tribes - known as iwi - over the death of nine indigenous people during the first meeting between Cook and the Maori. But she stopped short of issuing an apology.
Though James Cook's exploration of New Zealand dominates history books, Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was the first European to catch sight of it, in 1642. Maori people from Polynesian islands are believed to have arrived in New Zealand hundreds of years prior to the first Europeans.What celebrations are planned?New Zealand has planned several days of events to mark the milestone of the first meeting between Maori and Europeans. On Tuesday, a flotilla of ships including a replica of the Endeavour reached Gisborne, a city on the east coast of North Island. Members of Parliament Kelvin Davis and Kiritapu Allan went aboard to greet the crew. Protesters were also reportedly present in the town, which is also known by its Maori name of Turanga-nui-a-Kiwa.

New Zealand should continue to learn and tell the full story of its past, she added.Why is the anniversary controversial?When James Cook arrived on the Turanganui River, what is now Gisborne, the first encounter between his crew and the Maori inhabitants was deadly.A leader of the Ngati Oneone group was immediately shot and killed after what is believed to be a misunderstanding over a ceremonial challenge. At least eight other Maori were killed.

Despite the statement of regret, many Maori rights advocates say not enough has been down to acknowledge what happened in those first few days of Cook's arrival.""It's a commemoration or an anniversary of invasion and imperial expansion,"" said Tina Ngata, an indigenous rights advocate who has been leading the opposition to the commemoration events.Protesters also say their Maori ancestors were treated unfairly during the colonial era and that today, Maori communities face disproportionate levels of poverty, crime and discrimination as a result. In Gisborne, a statue of Cook has been repeatedly defaced with graffiti and is to be replaced."

He didn't find the mythical continent, but on 6 October his cabin boy, Nicholas Young, spotted New Zealand.The crew - including a Tahitian chief and navigator called Tupaia who helped Cook communicate with the Maori - came ashore at Tuuranga-nui, now Gisborne, on the east coast of North Island two days later.Cook went on to sail and chart much of the coast of New Zealand, stopping at several places and establishing relations with Maori residents.He also claimed possession of two areas in the name of the British crown, starting the process of colonisation.

Celebration and protestPhil Mercer, BBC News, GisborneCrowds were up at sunrise to watch as the replica of Cook's Endeavour sailed through Poverty Bay, or Taranganui-a-kiwa.""We are here to celebrate Captain James Cook and everything that he did and he represents our heritage of which we are very proud,"" said Val McGreevy, a Gisborne resident.   But here in Gisborne, the anniversary of Cook's landing has been a time for celebration, reflection and protest, and there was a hostile welcome from Maori groups. They are angry that Cook's arrival has been commemorated in such a significant way.  ""The fact that we have to re-live that traumatisation as a whanau hapu iwi [extended family groups and tribes] is actually quite devastating for us as Maori. Our indigenous rights have been breached over and over again,"" said Marise Lent, one of the demonstrators."

The three low paid workers and their union are launching a no-deal Brexit court case
Three low paid workers and their union are launching a legal challenge to make the prime minister seek an extension to the Brexit deadline.The government has promised EU-law derived employment rights will remain in UK law after Brexit. But if there were a no-deal Brexit, the union says, ministers would have free rein to water down these rights.And workers could no longer rely on the supremacy of EU law, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights or Court of Justice.The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents some 5,000 workers, 1,000 of whom are EU citizens, is currently relying upon these aspects of EU law in a number of worker's rights court cases.
Key workers' rights based on EU law include:
minimum paid holiday
working hours regulation
equal pay
protection against discrimination
consultation on redundancy plans
There are an estimated 3.5 million citizens of other EU member states living and working in the UK.

IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee told BBC News: ""Low paid workers, like couriers and cleaners, need all the protections and employment rights they can get. ""Many of these come from EU law and are at serious risk in a no-deal Brexit. ""The IWGB will do everything possible to protect these rights, including legal action to force the prime minister to obey the law and request an extension to the Brexit deadline.""The IWGB challenge joins a similar one in the English and Welsh courts brought by the rights group Liberty and one in the Scottish courts brought by businessman Dale Vince, Jolyon Maugham QC and SNP MP Joanna Cherry. The Scottish case was dismissed by the judge on Monday but the petitioners have announced their intention to appeal. 'Clear breach'The so-called Benn act, named after Labour's Hilary Benn who spearheaded the law's passage through Parliament, requires the prime minister to write to the EU to request an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline if a deal has not been signed off by Parliament by 19 October and if MPs have not voted to leave without a deal.All three actions claim Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he will not seek a time extension in the event of no-deal.It is argued those statements by the prime minister and members of the cabinet seek to frustrate an act of Parliament and so represent a clear breach of the rule of law.  All three actions seek orders compelling Mr Johnson to comply with the act and send a letter to the president of the European Council seeking an extension to 31 January 2020.

Boris Johnson says the government will obey the law - and leave the EU on 31 October
Mr Johnson has previously said the government ""will obey the law - and will come out on 31 October"" in any event, without specifying how he would achieve these apparently contradictory goals.The IWGB says such statements are an attempt to frustrate the purpose of the Benn act and are therefore unlawful.The prime minister's statements have led to speculation the government has identified a legal loophole to get around the Benn actIf the UK appears to be heading towards a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and the prime minister found a way to get around the Benn act, all three legal challenges could end up at the UK Supreme Court in a dramatic last-minute legal bid to prevent a no-deal departure just days before the deadline.'Cunning plan'On Friday, government papers submitted in the Scottish case stated the prime minister would send a letter to the EU asking for a Brexit delay if no deal was agreed by 19 October. Similar assurances, to obey the Benn act and not seek to frustrate it, have been given by the government to the IWGB in pre-action correspondence seen by BBC News.However, a senior Downing Street source has said: ""The government will comply with the Benn act, which only imposes a very specific narrow duty concerning Parliament's letter requesting a delay, drafted by an unknown subset of MPs and pro-EU campaigners, and which can be interpreted in different ways.""But the government is not prevented by the act from doing other things that cause no delay, including other communications, private and public.""People will have to wait to see how this is reconciled. ""The government is making its true position on delay known privately in Europe and this will become public soon.""This has led to increased speculation Downing Street has seen a way around the Benn act. Alternatively, as the BBC's Andrew Marr put it on Sunday: ""Maybe No 10's cunning plan is to pretend they have a cunning plan when actually they don't."""
